We developed an  easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360°  nature videos and interactive animated elements. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the  immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and  short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a  psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. METHODS: A  randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory  treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants  were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both  interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of  momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session.  Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after  both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed  model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Both VRelax  and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate  improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard  relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total  negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t(1684)=-2.02, 95% CI -18.70  to -0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on  momentary anxiety (t(1684)=-3.24, 95% CI -6.86 to -1.69), sadness (t(1684)=-2.32,  95% CI -6.51 to -0.55), and cheerfulness (t(1684)=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75).  There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two  treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: If the results  of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed,  effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance  psychiatric treatments.

Virtual reality  (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral  therapeutics for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a double-blind,  parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a  self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based  individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19  pandemic. METHODS: A national online convenience sample of individuals with  self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and  with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1  of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR  program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective  device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were  the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the  between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain  intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep  over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were  global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance,  pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use,  and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a  mixed-model framework. RESULTS: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%,  137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%,  163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2];  back pain duration ≥5 years: 67%, 120/179). No group differences were found for  any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were  higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<.001). For the between-groups factor,  EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009),  and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating  superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post  effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical  importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with  activity, mood, and stress. Between-group comparisons for Physical Function and  Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR  group (P=.022 and .013, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy,  pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not  reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter  analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR. CONCLUSIONS:  EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom  reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity,  mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine  durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment  effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand  nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

However, individuals with chronic  diseases that require lifelong treatment and experience exacerbations need  motivational methods. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the  effects of virtual reality on symptoms, daily living activity, functional  capacity, anxiety and depression levels in COPD exacerbation. METHODS: Fifty  patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation were included in the study. They were  randomly assigned to two groups. Twenty-five patients participated in a  traditional PR (once-daily until discharge), including pedaling exercises. The  second/25 patients followed the same protocol but experienced cycling simulation  in the forest via virtual reality (VR + PR). All patients were evaluated using  1-minute/Sit-to-Stand test (STST), modified-Medical Research Council (mMRC)  scale, COPD Assessment test (CAT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),  and London Chest Activities of Daily Living (LCADL) before and after the  treatment. RESULTS: The STST showed an increase in both groups post-treatment,  notably higher in the VR + PR (p = 0.037). Dyspnea levels and CAT scores  decreased in all patients, but the decrease was greater in the PR + VR group for  both parameters (p = 0.062, p = 0.003; respectively). Both groups experienced a  reduction in the HADS scores compared to the pre-treatment, with a more  significant decrease in depression and the total score in the VR + PR (p < 0.05).  LCADL's sub-parameters and total score, excluding household, decreased in both  groups after treatment (p < 0.05). The improvement was more substantial in the  VR + PR. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality provides benefits in the management of COPD  exacerbations and can be used safely.

One possible mechanism underpinning this evidence is  described by our framework: (susceptibility) adults in low socioeconomic  positions face higher exposure to persistent psychosocial stressors in early  life, inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype as a lifelong susceptibility to  stress; (differential susceptibility) susceptible adults are more sensitive to  the health risks of adverse (stress-promoting) environments, but also to the  health benefits of protective (stress-buffering) environments. OBJECTIVE:  Experimental investigation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype as a mechanism  facilitating greater stress recovery from nature exposure. METHODS: We determined  differences in stress recovery (via heart rate variability) caused by exposure to  a nature or office virtual reality environment (10 min) after an acute stressor  among 64 healthy college-age males with varying levels of susceptibility  (socioeconomic status, early life stress, and a pro-inflammatory state  [inflammatory reactivity and glucocorticoid resistance to an in vitro bacterial  challenge]). RESULTS: Findings for inflammatory reactivity and glucocorticoid  resistance were modest but consistently trended towards better recovery in the  nature condition. Differences in recovery were not observed for socioeconomic  status or early life stress. DISCUSSION: Among healthy college-age males, we  observed expected trends according to their differential susceptibility when  assessed as inflammatory reactivity and glucocorticoid resistance, suggesting  these biological correlates of susceptibility could be more proximal indicators  than self-reported assessments of socioeconomic status and early life stress. If  future research in more diverse populations aligns with these trends, this could  support an alternative conceptualization of susceptibility as increased  environmental sensitivity, reflecting heightened responses to adverse, but also  protective environments. With this knowledge, future investigators could examine  how individual differences in environmental sensitivity could provide an  opportunity for those who are the most susceptible to experience the greatest  health benefits from nature exposure.","2024","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:57","","e0301473","","4","19","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2024 Eisen et al.

Throughout the VR session, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, heart  rate variability, and skin conductance level and administered cognitive tests to  measure their reaction time and creativity. Compared to the base case,  participants in three spaces with biophilic elements had consistently lower level  of physiological stress indicators and higher creativity scores. In addition, we  captured the variation in the intensity of virtual exposure to biophilic elements  by using eye-tracking technology. These results suggest that biophilic  interventions could help reduce stress and improve creativity. Moreover, those  effects are related to both the types of biophilic elements and may be different  based on the workspace type (open vs enclosed). This research demonstrates that  VR-simulated office spaces are useful in differentiating responses to two  configurations and among biophilic elements.","2019-11","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:41","","1028-1039","","6","29","","Indoor Air","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Recently, virtual  reality (VR) has been used to regulate stress and improve overall wellness,  particularly by incorporating natural settings. In this randomized crossover  study, we designed five virtual classroom scenes with different biophilic  elements and turbidity in VR and investigated whether the visual stimulations can  affect the stress levels and cognitive functions of 30 young adults from a  university in China. We measured their physiological indicators of stress  reaction by wearable biomonitoring sensors (blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR),  heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance level (SCL)), conducted verbal  cognitive tests on attention and creativity, and evaluated subjective/perceived  (self-reported) stress levels and connection with nature.

Although virtual reality glasses  (VR-G) have been advanced for preoperative anxiety management, their  effectiveness specifically for open-heart surgery patients remains  under-researched. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of watching a video  through VR-G on surgical fear and anxiety levels of patients undergoing  open-heart surgery. DESIGN: A randomized controlled and double-blind study.  METHODS: In total, 90 patients were randomly assigned to the VR-G intervention  group or control group. On the surgery morning, intervention group patients  watched a 360-degree video with nature sounds through VR-G before being  transferred to the operating theater. The surgical fear and anxiety levels of the  patients were evaluated at three stages using the Surgical Fear Questionnaire and  Visual Analog Scale-Anxiety: initial evaluation in the morning, second evaluation  before being transferred, and third evaluation in the waiting room of the  operating theater. FINDINGS: The surgical fear level of the intervention group at  the third evaluation was significantly lower than the control group (P < .000).  There was no significant difference between the anxiety levels of the study  groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Watching a 360-degree video with nature sounds  through VR-G is an effective intervention in reducing surgical fear levels of  patients before undergoing open-heart surgery. Use of VR-G interventions may be  a practical and fast-resulting nursing strategy to manage patients' surgical fear  in the preoperative period.

This pilot study evaluated  the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-week, 8-session  nature-mindfulness-compassion program using immersive virtual reality  (Embodied-and-Embedded-Mindfulness-Compassion-Framework - Virtual-Reality  (EEMCF-VR)) for older adults' mental health. METHODS: Following a mixed-methods,  two-arm, open-label RCT design, 24 older adults (M(age) = 75.1, SD = 6.58) were  randomly assigned to EEMCF-VR (n = 12) or a psychoeducational pamphlet control  group (n = 12). Participants completed self-report assessments of stress,  positive and negative emotions, coping self-efficacy, psychosocial well-being,  mindfulness, and nature connectedness at baseline (T1), midpoint (T2),  post-intervention (T3), and 4-week follow-up (T4). Additionally, the EEMCF-VR  group completed program feedback (T3) and simulator sickness (T1-T3)  questionnaires. RESULTS: EEMCF-VR met feasibility benchmarks (recruitment targets  achieved, attrition < 15%) and was well-tolerated (minimal simulator sickness).  Participant feedback indicated high acceptability. The EEMCF-VR group reported  significantly lower stress and negative emotions at T2 and T4 compared to  controls. Qualitative analysis highlighted perceived benefits and components to  retain (e.g. video content) or refine (e.g. headset weight). CONCLUSIONS:  EEMCF-VR demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, with promising effects on  stress and mood, warranting investigation in larger trials.

The present study  is novel because it a) builds on evidence that natural scenery is beneficial for  patients, and b) uses a Virtual Reality (VR) representation of nature to distract  participants. Extending previous work that has investigated pain and anxiety  during treatment, c) we also consider the longer term effects in terms of more  positive memories of the treatment, building on a cognitive theory of memory  (Elaborated Intrusions).

In addition, participants were distinguished into high and  low dentally anxious according to a median split resulting in a 3×2  between-subjects design. VR distraction in a simulated dental context affected  memories a week later. The VR distraction had effects not only on concurrent  experiences, such as perceived control, but longitudinally upon the vividness of  memories after the dental experience had ended. Participants with higher dental  anxiety (for whom the dental procedures were presumably more aversive) showed a  greater reduction in memory vividness than lower dental-anxiety participants.  This study thus suggests that VR distractions can be considered as a relevant  intervention for cycles of care in which people's previous experiences affect  their behaviour for future events.","2014","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:45","","e91276","","3","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24621518  PMCID: PMC3951355","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; *Computer Simulation; Anxiety/*prevention & control; Dentistry/*methods; Follow-Up Studies; Memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial design. SETTING: Spinal Cord Injury  Rehabilitation Unit in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=24) were assigned  to a group engaging in VR sessions during week 1 (group 1, n=10) or week 2 (group  2, n=14). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention week involved participation in up to  three 20-minute VR sessions over 3 consecutive days. The control condition  involved regular rehabilitation practice over a week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The  Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) was completed prior to the first week  (T1), after the first week and prior to the second week (T2), and after the  second week (T3). Current feeling states, including depressed/happy,  anxious/relaxed, and not feeling good/feeling good, were rated immediately prior  and after each VR session. RESULTS: Levels of happiness, relaxation, and feeling  good were significantly higher subsequent to engaging with each VR session.  Between-group differences in PHQ-8 scores were significantly greater for  participants who experienced the intervention during the first week compared to  participants within the control group: intervention participants had significant  improvements in psycho-emotional health. Within-group PHQ-8 scores were reduced  for each group subsequent to experiencing the intervention; however, differences  were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging with simulated natural environments  delivered via VR can favorably affect the psycho-emotional health of people with  SCI receiving rehabilitation in hospital.

However, there has been limited exploration into the combined effects of green  walls and outdoor views on older adults. In this study, a between-subjects  experiment was conducted using virtual reality (VR) technology with 23  participants. Following exposure to stressors, each participant underwent four  randomized sessions, each lasting 5 min, in various virtual reality (VR)  environments, encompassing non-biophilic and biophilic environments (including  green walls, outdoor views, and their combination). Throughout the process, we  measured physiological indicators of stress responses, including heart rate,  heart rate variability, skin conductance levels, and blood pressure, using  biometric sensors. Psychological changes in participants, including anxiety  levels, were evaluated through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, recovery  scales, and self-reported emotional assessments. In conclusion, in comparison to  non-biophilic environments, older adults consistently exhibited lower stress  levels, experienced superior anxiety relief, and demonstrated improved recovery  in nature connectedness environments, with a notably faster recovery rate. These  findings suggest that the incorporation of nature connectedness principles into  the indoor environments of public activity spaces within older adults care  facilities can significantly contribute to stress reduction and anxiety  alleviation among older adults. Furthermore, these effects appear to be  contingent on the specific types of nature connectedness environments. These  results can provide substantial evidence to support the design of indoor common  activity spaces within older adults care facilities.","2024","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:52","","1352611","","","12","","Front Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Xiaoxue and Huang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38686034  PMCID: PMC11057236","","","","*Virtual Reality; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; *Anxiety/psychology; *Stress, Psychological/psychology; Heart Rate/physiology; biometric monitoring sensors; indoor public activity spaces; nature connectedness; older adults; physiological responses; virtual reality (VR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical disabilities, impaired social engagement, and environmental  stress are also common in LTCF which exacerbate the decline of the mental  well-being of older people living in LTCF. Protective elements, including  nature-based, reminiscence, outdoor, and group activities, are known to be  effective to promote the mental well-being of older people living in LTCF.  However, limited by their physical disabilities and poor social support, older  people living in LTCF are not likely to benefit from these effective measures.  Virtual reality has been proven to be feasible to be environmentally unrestricted  to providing LTCF residents with all protective elements promoting mental  well-being. However, its effects on the mental well-being of LTCF residents  living with physical disabilities are unclear. METHODS: This study employs a  single-blinded, two-parallel-group (intervention-to-control group ratio = 1:1),  non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are aged  60 years or above, LTCF residents, and living with physical disabilities. The  study will be conducted in LTCF. In the intervention group, participants will  receive a 6-week VR experience program. In the control group, participants will  receive the usual care provided by the LTCF. The primary outcome is mental  well-being, as measured by World Health Organization Five Well-being Index at the  time point of baseline (i.e., week 0) and after completion of the intervention  (i.e., week 7). This study aims to recruit a total of 216 participants.  Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to examine the effects of the  intervention.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of  various combinations of VR and music on short-term mood, thereby providing a  reference for future research on public fitness. This study recruited 132 valid  participants (mean age 24.0 ± 0.9 years), with a gender distribution of 68 males  and 64 females. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups:  Visual-Music (V-M), Music-Visual (M-V), Visual-only (V), and Music-only (M). The  exercise mode was 15 min of aerobic power cycling with 2 min of low-intensity  power cycling intervals in the middle. After the exercise, the participants were  asked to sit and then performed either a VR intervention or a music intervention  for 15 min. The collected indicators included blood pressure, positive/negative  affect, and heart rate variability indicators (RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF). Data analysis  included descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and multifactor ANOVA.  The effect of different VR and Music combined with exercise interventions on the  improvement of short-term affect was analyzed based on the effect size (ɳp(2))  and combined with the significance p-value. Intra-group results showed that DBP,  positive and negative affect, SDNN, RMSSD indicators in V-M group were  significant differences (p < 0.05), while SBP, positive affect, negative affect,  SDNN, RMSSD, LF/HF indicators in M-V group were significant differences  (p < 0.05). Only SDNN and RMSSD indicators in M group had significant differences  (p < 0.05), and only SBP and RMSSD indicators in V group had significant  differences (p < 0.05). The results between groups showed that only SDNN and  LH/HF groups had a significant difference (p < 0.05), other indicators had a  trend of improvement or positive promotion to a certain extent, but the  statistical difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Aerobic exercise with  consistent intensity and the combined visual-auditory interventions (M-V and V-M)  significantly improved blood pressure, and the short-term affect of physiological  responses (LF/HF, SDNN, RMSSD), along with subjective affect measures, compared  to other groups. These findings suggest that incorporating VR and music with  exercise can effectively enhance short-term affect, recommending an integrated  approach to aerobic exercise and relaxation through music and visual exposure to  natural environments.","2024-08-16","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:50:01","","18995","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

PROs are commonly  evaluated at weekly intervals with data collected via digital surveys. While  weekly assessments have benefits, VR devices enable more frequent in-device data  collection. It remains unclear whether PROs collected more frequently provide  more information on these interventions than PROs collected more infrequently.  OBJECTIVE: This pilot study explored differences between daily and weekly PRO  data collection in a VR intervention with nature imagery, with and without guided  imagery, among patients with cancer. METHODS: Patients with cancer (n=8) were  randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: (1) virtual  reality-assisted guided imagery (VRAGI), (2) VR without guided imagery, (3)  desktop VR with guided imagery, or (4) desktop VR without guided imagery. Devices  were mailed to participants' homes for 15-20 minutes of daily use over 3 weeks.  Weekly outcomes (pain, anxiety, depression, and well-being) were assessed using  items from the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Daily outcomes were captured  via in-device pre-post surveys. Data were analyzed descriptively, using visual  trend comparisons to explore patterns. RESULTS: Of 41 patients who consented, 8  provided complete and usable data. Weekly outcomes showed no consistent trends.  In contrast, daily data revealed more nuanced patterns, such as early symptom  relief, plateaus, and ""double-bottom"" effects. The addition of guided imagery did  not consistently enhance outcomes beyond VR alone, although the VRAGI condition  showed the greatest improvement in well-being. Given the small sample size, these  findings should be considered exploratory. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests  that daily PRO data might offer richer insight into intervention effects than  weekly assessments. Further research with larger samples is needed to confirm  these patterns.","2025-07-29","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:50:10","","e73506","","","9","","JMIR Form Res","","","","","","","","eng","© Matthew Browning, Olivia McAnirlin, Fu Li, Jeffrey Bertrand, Denise Davis, Kapil Madathil, Fredric Mau, Teny Henry Gomez.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:  watching a 360° video of nature, a 360° video of a city environment, or no  virtual experience. The intervention was performed only for one session.  Psychological stress was measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule  and Perceived Stress Scale before and after the intervention. Physiological  stress was assessed through respiratory rate, skin conductance, and heart rate  recordings during the virtual reality (VR) experience. Data analysis was  performed using R software (version 4.2). RESULTS: Paired t-test results  indicated significant psychological differences before and after virtual nature  experiences, but not in the control and city groups. The repeated measure ANOVA  showed a significant reduction in skin conductance (p < 0.01) and respiratory  rate (p < 0.01) scores in the nature group.

Although many mechanisms may partially account for this effect,  disadvantaged neighborhood environments are hypothesized to elicit stress and  emotional responses that accumulate over time and influence physical and mental  health. However, evidence for neighborhood effects on stress and emotion is  limited due to methodological challenges. In order to address this question, we  developed a virtual reality experimental model of neighborhood disadvantage and  affluence and examined the effects of simulated neighborhoods on immediate stress  and emotion. Exposure to neighborhood disadvantage resulted in greater negative  emotion, less positive emotion, and more compassion, compared to exposure to  affluence. However, the effect of virtual neighborhood environments on blood  pressure and electrodermal reactivity depended on parental education.  Participants from families with lower education exhibited greater reactivity to  the disadvantaged neighborhood, while those from families with higher education  exhibited greater reactivity to the affluent neighborhood. These results  demonstrate that simulated neighborhood environments can elicit immediate stress  reactivity and emotion, but the nature of physiological effects depends on  sensitization to prior experience.","2019-07-01","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:49","","9498","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31263211  PMCID: PMC6602955","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; *Mental Health; Socioeconomic Factors; *Emotions; *Residence Characteristics; *Stress, Psychological/physiopathology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing VR  products and services have limited availability and affordability; hence, there  is a need for a scientifically validated and personalized VR service to be used  by older adults in their homes, which can improve their overall physical,  cognitive, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of the CoSoPhy FX  (Cognitive, Social, and Physical Effects) study was to analyze the effects of a  VR-based digital therapeutics app on the cognitive, social, and physical  performance abilities of healthy (high-functioning) older adults. This paper  presents the study protocol and the results from the recruitment phase. METHODS:  A group of 188 healthy older adults aged 65-85 years, recruited at the Medical  University of Lodz, Poland, were randomly allocated to the experimental group (VR  dual-task training program) or to the control group (using a VR headset app  showing nature videos). A total of 3 cognitive exercises were performed in  various 360° nature environments delivered via a VR head-mounted display; the  participants listened to their preferred music genre. Each patient received 3  sessions of 12 minutes per week for 12 weeks, totaling a minimum of 36 sessions  per participant. Attention and working memory (Central Nervous System Vital Signs  computerized cognitive battery) were used as primary outcomes, while other  cognitive domains in the Central Nervous System Vital Signs battery, quality of  life (World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index), health-related quality of  life (EQ-5D-5L), and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire) were  the secondary outcomes. The group-by-time interaction was determined using linear  mixed models with participants' individual slopes. RESULTS: In total, 122 (39%)  of the initial 310 participants failed to meet the inclusion criteria, resulting  in a recruitment rate of 61% (188/310). Among the participants, 68 successfully  completed the intervention and 62 completed the control treatment. The data are  currently being analyzed, and we plan to publish the results by the end of  September 2024. CONCLUSIONS: VR interventions have significant potential among  healthy older individuals. VR can address various aspects of well-being by  stimulating cognitive functions, promoting physical activity, and facilitating  social interaction. However, challenges such as physical discomfort, technology  acceptance, safety concerns, and cost must be considered when implementing them  for older adults. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects  of VR-based interventions, optimal intervention designs, and the specific  populations that would benefit most.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: This mixed methods study included a prospective multi-centre  randomised controlled trial and structured individual interviews. Of the 72  patients approached, 50 consenting, eligible participants were randomised to VR  intervention (immersive video content 'The Forest of Serenity') or standard care  during MVA for the management of miscarriage or incomplete abortion from July  2021-July 2022 across two university hospitals in London, UK. Expected and actual  pain scores, and anxiety before and after the procedure were measured as numeric  rating scores (0-10). Structured interviews were undertaken after the procedure  in women randomised to VR. Statistical analysis of pain and anxiety scores were  by intention-to-treat including all randomised participants, using Stata-12  software. Qualitative analysis was achieved by thematic analysis of transcribed  interviews. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pain or anxiety  scores reported by participants randomised to VR compared with standard care.  Mean worst pain scores were 5.98 and 6.88 in the standard care and VR groups  respectively (p-value 0.13), with corresponding anxiety scores at the end of the  procedure 3.94 and 3.3 (p-value 0.57). Qualitative analysis from interviews was  highly favourable from women randomised to VR with all participants reporting a  positive experience. 90% (18/20) of participants reported that VR reduced their  anxiety and 71% (15/21) stated that it helped to reduce or distract from their  pain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled  split-mouth study included 60 patients who scored 9 or above on the dental  anxiety scale (DAS) and required SRP in at least two quadrants with at least five  teeth and two sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. Randomly chosen quadrants were  treated using virtual reality glasses, and other quadrants were treated without  glasses at the same visit. During VRD, a video of nature scenes was projected  onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. DAS and a visual analogue scale  about patient feelings were applied at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: With  VRD, the scale value of pain and discomfort level (VASP) was significantly  reduced (p = 0.01, d = 0.57). Starting treatment without glasses significantly  decreased VASP in both control and test sides (p = 0.00, d = 0.85; p = 0.00,  d = 0.80, respectively) and increased the sensation of immersion and realism  (p = 0.03, d = 0.45; p = 0.02, d = 0.46, respectively). Intraoperative and  postoperative DAS values were significantly lower in patients who started  treatment without VRD (p = 0.04, d = 0.34; p = 0.02, d = 0.44, respectively). Of  the patients, 63.3% preferred VRD in the subsequent treatment. While patient  preference did not correlate with sex, it correlated with age (r = -0.48,  p = 0.01).

This study was intended to explore the psychological and  physiological responses of patients with GAD after cycling in a virtual  environment containing natural images. Seventy-seven participants with GAD were  recruited in the present study and randomly assigned to a virtual nature (VN) or  a virtual abstract painting (VAP) group. Their electroencephalogram alpha  activity, perceived stress, and levels of restorative quality and satisfaction  were assessed at baseline and after an acute bout of 20 min of moderate-intensity  aerobic exercise. The results showed that both the VN and VAP groups showed  significantly higher alpha activity post-exercise as compared to pre-exercise.  The VN group relative to the VAP group exhibited higher levels of stress-relief,  restorative quality, and personal satisfaction. These findings imply that a  virtual exercise environment is an effective way to induce a relaxing effect in  patients with GAD. However, they exhibited more positive psychological responses  when exercising in such an environment with natural landscapes.","2020-07-06","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:52","","","","13","17","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 32640554  PMCID: PMC7370051","","","","EEG; *Virtual Reality; Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; *Anxiety Disorders/therapy; *Exercise; acute exercise; Electroencephalography; Exercise Therapy; generalized anxiety disorder; perceived stress; restorative quality; satisfaction; virtual environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over 70%  of patients report moderate to high pain and anxiety surrounding TKA surgery, and  96% are discharged with an opioid prescription. This population requires special  attention as approximately 90% of TKA patients are older adults and one of the  riskiest groups prone to misusing opioids. This study aimed to develop and  compare the efficacy of nature-based virtual reality (VR) with heart rate  variability biofeedback (HRV(BF)) to mitigate surgical pain and anxiety. METHODS:  This randomized control trial recruited 30 patients (mean age = 66.3 ± 8.2 years,  23 F, 7 M) undergoing TKA surgery and randomly assigned to a control, 2D video  with HRV(BF), or VR with HRV(BF) group. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to  measure pain levels before and after the intervention. In addition, a second VAS  and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to measure anxiety before  and after the intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to continuously  measure HRV and respiration rate in preoperative and postoperative settings.  RESULTS: VR and 2D-video with HRV(BF) decreased pain and anxiety  post-intervention compared with the control group, p's <.01. On analyzing  physiological signals, both treatment groups showed greater parasympathetic  activity levels, and VR with HRV(BF) reduced pain more than the 2D video, p <  .01. CONCLUSIONS: Nature-based VR and 2D video with HRV(BF) can mitigate surgical  pain and anxiety.

A Randomized Control Trial of Pediatric Virtual Reality for Acute Procedural Pain Management.","Journal of pediatric psychology","","1465-735X 0146-8693","10.1093/jpepsy/jsx129","","OBJECTIVE: To conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of virtual reality (VR) compared with standard of care (SOC) for  reducing pain, anxiety, and improving satisfaction associated with blood draw in  children ages 10-21 years. METHODS: In total, 143 triads (patients, their  caregiver, and the phlebotomist) were recruited in outpatient phlebotomy at a  pediatric hospital and randomized to receive either VR or SOC when undergoing  routine blood draw. Patients and caregivers completed preprocedural and  postprocedural standardized measures of pain, anxiety, and satisfaction, and  phlebotomists reported about the patient's experience during the procedure.  RESULTS: Findings showed that VR significantly reduced acute procedural pain and  anxiety compared with SOC. A significant interaction between patient-reported  anxiety sensitivity and treatment condition indicated that patients undergoing  routine blood draw benefit more from VR intervention when they are more fearful  of physiological sensations related to anxiety. Patients and caregivers in the VR  condition reported high levels of satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSION: VR  is feasible, tolerated, and well-liked by patients, caregivers, and phlebotomists  alike for routine blood draw. Given the immersive and engaging nature of the VR  experience, VR has the capacity to act as a preventive intervention transforming  the blood draw experience into a less distressing, potentially pain-free routine  medical procedure, particularly for pediatric patients with high anxiety  sensitivity. VR holds promise to reduce negative health outcomes for children and  reduce distress in caregivers, while facilitating increased satisfaction and  throughput in hectic outpatient phlebotomy clinics.","2018-04-01","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:46","","266-275","","3","43","","J Pediatr Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29053848","","","","*Virtual Reality; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Pain Management/*methods; Young Adult; Child; *Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Acute Pain/*therapy; Pain, Procedural/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of access to nature in closed  psychiatric wards may exacerbate patients' perceived stress, while virtual  reality (VR)-based immersive nature technology offers an innovative solution.  METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a short-term, low-dose VR  nature immersion protocol (10 min per day for 3 consecutive days) on hospitalized  psychiatric patients in China. This study employed a randomized controlled trial  design, enrolling 60 inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder or bipolar  disorder. Seven participants withdrew, leaving 27 in the VR nature group and 26  in the VR city control group. Intervention effects were measured using  multidimensional indicators, including psychological scales, physiological  indicators, and immediate emotion. RESULTS: The VR nature group exhibited  significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety, along with  significantly increased connectedness to nature. Physiological data indicated  that the VR nature group had significantly lower heart rates compared to the  control group. After a single VR session, the VR nature group demonstrated a  significant improvement in positive emotions and a marked reduction in negative  emotions. CONCLUSION: This research provides evidence that short-term VR nature  immersion effectively alleviates stress and emotional in hospitalized psychiatric  patients. The consistent results across psychological, physiological, and  immediate emotional indicators validate its efficacy. The proposed lightweight  protocol is both clinically feasible and safe, offering a new pathway for stress  intervention in closed psychiatric wards.","2025-12-15","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:59","","119942","","","391","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the  hypothesis that a virtual reality program (AppliedVR) decreases acute  postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients recovering from hip  arthroplasty. We also evaluated whether virtual reality distraction improves  patient mobility and reduces the need for antiemetics. METHODS: We evaluated 106  adults who were recovering from elective primary total hip arthroplasty.  Participating patients were randomized to 2- to 8-minute-long 3-dimensional  immersive virtual reality relaxation and distraction video presentations (eg,  guided breathing exercises, games, mindfulness) or to 2-dimensional presentations  of nature short films (eg, forest wildlife) with neutral music that was chosen to  be neither overly relaxing nor distracting, presented through identical headsets.  Our primary outcome was pain after virtual reality or sham video presentations,  adjusted for pretreatment scores. Secondary outcomes included total opioid  consumption, pain scores obtained per routine by nurse staff, perception of video  system usability, and pain 1 week after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Fifty-two  patients were randomized to virtual reality distraction and relaxation, and 54  were assigned to 2-dimensional sham presentations. Virtual reality presentations  were not found to affect pain scores before and after presentations, with an  estimated difference in means (virtual reality minus sham video) of -0.1 points  (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.5 to 0.2; P = .391) on a 0 to 10 scale, with 10  being the worst.

In the original analysis (n = 338),  published in 2019, GE-XR did not differ from placebo. Our aim is to advance  precision medicine by identifying likely responders to GE-XR from the trial data  and to determine for likely responders if GE-XR is causally superior to placebo.  METHODS: The primary outcome measure in the reanalysis is the reduction from  baseline of the number of heavy drinking days (ΔHDD). Baseline features including  measures of alcohol use, anxiety, depression, mood states, sleep, and impulsivity  were used in a random forest (RF) model to predict ΔHDD to treatment with GE-XR  based on those assigned to GE-XR. The resulting RF model was used to obtain  predicted outcomes for those randomized to GE-XR and counterfactually to those  randomized to placebo. Likely responders to GE-XR were defined as those predicted  to have a reduction of 14 days or more. Tests of causal superiority of GE-XR to  placebo were obtained for likely responders and for the whole sample. RESULTS:  For likely responders, GE-XR was causally superior to placebo (p < 0.0033), while  for the whole sample, there was no difference. Likely responders exhibited  improved outcomes for the related outcomes of percent HDD and drinks per week.  Compared with unlikely responders, at baseline likely responders had higher HDDs;  lower levels of anxiety, depression, and general mood disturbances; and higher  levels of cognitive and motor impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial  causal benefits of treatment with GE-XR for a subset of patients predicted to be  likely responders.

Additionally, prior animal  model and psychological studies would suggest that subjects with greatest  symptoms at baseline may have the greatest violation of expectancy to danger when  undergoing exposure based psychotherapy; thus treatment approaches which enhanced  the learning under these conditions would be optimal for those with maximal  baseline cue-dependent reactivity. However methods to study this hypothesis  objectively are lacking. Virtual reality (VR) methodologies have been  successfully employed as an enhanced form of imaginal prolonged exposure therapy  for the treatment of PTSD. Our goal was to examine the predictive nature of  initial psychophysiological (e.g., startle, skin conductance, heart rate) and  stress hormone responses (e.g., cortisol) during presentation of VR-based  combat-related stimuli on PTSD treatment outcome. Combat veterans with PTSD  underwent 6 weeks of VR exposure therapy combined with either d-cycloserine  (DCS), alprazolam (ALP), or placebo (PBO). In the DCS group, startle response to  VR scenes prior to initiation of treatment accounted for 76% of the variance in  CAPS change scores, p < 0.001, in that higher responses predicted greater changes  in symptom severity over time. Additionally, baseline cortisol reactivity was  inversely associated with treatment response in the ALP group, p = 0.04. We  propose that baseline cue-activated physiological measures will be sensitive to  predicting patients' level of response to exposure therapy, in particular in the  presence of enhancement (e.g., DCS).","2016-07","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:22","","28-37","","","82","","Behav Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27183343  PMCID: PMC5392238","","","","Virtual reality; Psychophysiology; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Young Adult; Treatment Outcome; *Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; Acoustic startle; Alprazolam/therapeutic use; Combined Modality Therapy; Cortisol; Cycloserine/therapeutic use; Exposure therapy; Galvanic Skin Response/*physiology; Heart Rate/*physiology; Hydrocortisone/*metabolism; Photic Stimulation; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Reference Values; Reflex, Startle/*physiology; Saliva/metabolism; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/drug therapy/*physiopathology/therapy; Veterans/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also used a portable water wall (PW) device that provides a natural  appearance with irregular stones and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. The aim  of this study was to investigate the effects of PW, an artificial natural water  wall device, and VRF on patient anxiety, satisfaction, comfort, and vital signs  before a colonoscopy procedure. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized clinical trial.  METHODS: The study was completed with 135 participants (45 in the PW group, 45 in  the VRF group, and 45 in the control group). Data were collected using the  Patient Information Form, Vital Signs Record Form, and the State-Trait Anxiety  Inventory. FINDINGS: The study's findings demonstrated that, in both the PW and  VRF groups, there were substantial increases in satisfaction, comfort,  respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels, and significant decreases in  anxiety, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < .05). The  means of the variables in the control group before and after the surgery did not  differ significantly (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: According to the study results,  precolonoscopy PW and VRF reduced anxiety, increased satisfaction and comfort,  and had a positive effect on vital signs. The results of this study will  contribute to evidence-based nursing practices for disturbances associated with  colonoscopy. PWs' sound and visual elements can have a calming and relaxing  effect, and VR is a simple, affordable technology that can be used to provide  patients better care.","2025-10","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:50:01","","1252-1259","","5","40","","J Perianesth Nurs","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2025 The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.

While the PASAT has demonstrated high levels of internal consistency  and test-retest reliability, administration of the PASAT has been known to create  undue anxiety and frustration in participants. As a result, degradation of  performance may be found on the PASAT. The difficult nature of the PASAT may  subsequently decrease the probability of their return for follow up testing. NEW  METHOD: This study is a preliminary attempt at assessing the potential of a PASAT  embedded in a virtual reality environment. The Virtual Reality PASAT (VR-PASAT)  was compared with a paper-and-pencil version of the PASAT as well as other  standardized neuropsychological measures. The two modalities of the PASAT were  conducted with a sample of 50 healthy university students, between the ages of 19  and 34 years. Equivalent distributions were found for age, gender, education, and  computer familiarity. RESULTS: Moderate relationships were found between VR-PASAT  and other putative attentional processing measures. The VR-PASAT was unrelated to  indices of learning, memory, or visuospatial processing. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING  METHOD(S): Comparison of the VR-PASAT with the traditional paper-and-pencil PASAT  indicated that both versions require the examinee to sustain attention at an  increasingly demanding, externally determined rate. CONCLUSIONS: Results offer  preliminary support for the construct validity (in a college sample) of the  VR-PASAT as an attentional processing measure and suggest that this task may  provide some unique information not tapped by traditional attentional processing  tasks.","2014-01-30","2025-11-07 06:45:02","2025-11-07 06:49:14","","15-23","","","222","","J Neurosci Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

SUMMARY ANSWER: An HSG  with VR does not reduce procedural pain scores compared to an HSG without VR.  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: An HSG is often experienced as painful and uncomfortable.  VR has been proven successful to reduce acute procedural pain during a variety of  medical procedures and interventions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed  a two-centre open-label randomized controlled trial between January 2021 and  October 2022. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women scheduled for HSG  as part of their infertility work-up were screened for participation. After  informed consent, women were randomized between HSG with or without VR. Due to  the nature of the intervention, the study was not blinded. VR was administered by  a head-mounted device displaying nature movies and/or relaxation exercises. The  primary endpoint was procedural pain measured using VAS (scale 0.0-10.0 cm).  Procedural pain was divided into overall pain score and peak pain score during  the procedure. It was measured immediately after HSG. Secondary endpoints  included patient satisfaction, VR preferences, and adverse effects of VR. MAIN  RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We included a total of 134 women, 69 to the  intervention group (HSG with VR) and 65 to the control group (HSG without VR).  The mean VAS for peak pain was 6.80 cm (SD 2.25) in the intervention group versus  6.60 cm (SD 2.40) in the control group (mean difference 0.28 (95% CI -0.57,  1.12), P = 0.52). The mean VAS for overall pain was 5.00 cm (SD 2.10) in the  intervention group versus 4.90 cm (SD 2.13) in the control group (mean difference  0.06 (95% CI -0.71, 0.84), P = 0.88). The expectation that VR would be a good  distraction from pain during HSG was correlated with both overall and peak pain  scores. When correcting for this expectation, we found that women in the  intervention group reported significantly higher scores, both in peak (adjusted  MD 0.58 (95% CI -0.81, 1.97), P = 0.021) and overall (adjusted MD 0.43 (95% CI  -0.84, 1.71), P = 0.013) pain, compared to the control group. There were no  differences in the prevalence of symptoms that were considered as adverse effects  of VR. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study was not blinded. Reasons for  declining participation in the study were anxiety or wanting full control during  HSG, which might have created selection bias. The distraction score possibly  indicates that the level of VR immersiveness was not optimal due to the lack of  sound and/or the type of VR applications. Future studies should investigate  whether more immersive or interactive VR applications could decrease procedural  pain scores during HSG. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Since VR does not  reduce procedural pain, this additional tool should not be used during HSG.

However, studies on VR-based BF are lacking and inconclusive. METHODS:  A total of 131 adults were recruited from the community. Participants who scored  ≥10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or ≥9 on the Panic Disorder  Severity Scale (PDSS) were included in the group with depressive or anxiety  symptoms (DAS group), and others as the healthy control group (HC group).  Participants from the DAS group were randomly assigned to VR-based or  conventional BF intervention. All individuals visited at three times (weeks 0, 2,  and 4), and completed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analog scale (VAS) before and  after the intervention, and PHQ-9 at the beginning and final visit. RESULTS: The  analysis included a total of 118 participants (DAS/VR: 40, DAS/BF: 38, HC/VR:  40). There was no significant difference in demographic variables among the three  groups. After the intervention, the DAS/VR group exhibited significant decreases  in MADRS (70.0 %), PHQ-9 (64.1 %), STAI (29.5 %), and VAS (61.7 %) scores  compared to the baseline (p <0.001). There were no significant differences  between the effects of VR-based BF and conventional BF with a therapist. The HC  group also showed significant decreases in the measures of depression and anxiety  after receiving VR-based BF.

Towards the  development of innovative technologies to correct burnout in the context of  psychosocial rehabilitation, we present our study protocol involving the ReViSide  virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback intervention, including monitoring of  respiratory rates and EEG rhythms. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial  protocol includes adult participants aged 18 to 65 years (n=140) who exhibit  emotional burnout in the workplace. The intervention group will undergo a course  of VR correction (ReViSide), while the control group receives a standard  psychocorrection. The primary endpoint will be level of emotional burnout to the  Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). We shall also assess anxiety, depression,  asthenia and subjective improvement in condition using validated scales (HADS,  HARS, HDRS, VAS-A, PGI-C). RESULTS: We shall test our hypothesis that the  VR-correction group will show significant improvements in MBI scores,  particularly in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal  accomplishment, compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures are  likewise expected to demonstrate more prominent improvements in the VR group,  correlating with the magnitude of burnout reduction to MBI. Analysis of EEG data  may reveal changes in alpha rhythm patterns during VR sessions, potentially  correlating with reduced distress levels. CONCLUSIONS: We designed this study to  test the integration of an interdisciplinary approach for treating burnout,  highlighting the ReViSide technology. Confirming the efficacy of this approach  for psychosocial rehabilitation targeting burnout states among employees should  improve their stress resilience, daily motivation, and work productivity in the  context of the modern high working pressure environment and demanding corporate  culture.","2024-09","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","354-360","","Suppl 2","36","","Psychiatr Danub","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Croatia PMID: 39378496","","","","*Virtual Reality; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Electroencephalography; *Burnout, Professional/prevention & control/therapy; Adaptation, Psychological/physiology; biofeedback – burnout – ReViSide - stress at workplace - virtual reality; Biofeedback, Psychology/methods; Burnout, Psychological; Occupational Stress; Workplace/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: In this randomized, controlled pilot study, 50 adults with chronic  migraine were randomized to the experimental group (frequent use of a heart rate  variability biofeedback-virtual reality device plus standard medical care; n=25)  or wait-list control group (standard medical care alone; n=25). The primary  outcome was a reduction in mean monthly headache days between groups at 12 weeks.  Secondary outcomes included mean change in acute analgesic use frequency,  depression, migraine-related disability, stress, insomnia, and catastrophizing  between groups at 12 weeks. Tertiary outcomes included change in heart rate  variability and device-related user experience measures. RESULTS: A statistically  significant reduction in mean monthly headache days between groups was not  demonstrated at 12 weeks. However, statistically significant decreases in the  mean frequency of total acute analgesic use per month (65% decrease in the  experimental group versus 35% decrease in the control group, P <0.01) and  depression score (35% decrease in the experimental group versus 0.5% increase in  the control group; P <0.05) were shown at 12 weeks. At study completion, more  than 50% of participants reported device satisfaction on a 5-level Likert scale.  DISCUSSION: Frequent use of a portable biofeedback-virtual reality device was  associated with decreases in the frequency of acute analgesic use and in  depression in individuals with chronic migraine. This platform holds promise as  an add-on treatment for chronic migraine, especially for individuals aiming to  decrease acute analgesic use or interested in nonmedication approaches.","2023-06-01","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","286-296","","6","39","","Clin J Pain","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, typical biofeedback  products often lead to user fatigue and boredom because of a single or fixed  feedback and lack of focus on mindfulness enhancement. Materials and Methods: In  this research, we developed Mindjourney, a VR-based respiratory feedback  mindfulness system, designed to enhance mindfulness and alleviate anxiety through  continuous/noncontinuous feedback and nonjudgmental reward/punishment for  self-perception and attention management. A randomized controlled trial involved  72 college students, split equally into short-term (n = 34, age: 23.11 ± 1.729)  and 4-week long-term (n = 38, age: 24.12 ± 1.408) groups, with equal  randomization for intervention and control groups. Pre/postintervention tests  were measured by using Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and Five Facet Mindfulness  Questionnaire (FFMQ) for long-term groups and Galvanic Skin Response and State  Anxiety Inventory (SAI) for short-term groups. Results: Results showed that the  long-term intervention group showed a significant increase in mindfulness (P =  0.001 for FFMQ total score). Furthermore, observe and act with awareness  subscales showed significant increase after intervention (P = 0.034 for observe,  P < 0.001 for act with awareness) compared with the control group. Both  intervention groups demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels  compared with the control groups (P = 0.049 for SAI, P = 0.01 for TAI). Moreover,  participants expressed high interest in this biofeedback mindfulness system and  willingness for long-term usage. Conclusion: The proposed biofeedback mindfulness  practice system could potentially facilitate mindfulness practice and serve as a  convenient tool for anxiety relief in campus college students.","2024-10","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","379-388","","5","13","","Games Health J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38808471","","","","mindfulness; biofeedback; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Mindfulness/methods; *Anxiety/therapy/psychology; *Biofeedback, Psychology/methods/instrumentation; *Students/psychology/statistics & numerical data; interactive design; mindfulness practice; Universities/organization & administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though physiological arousal is  reliably elevated in PTSD, the question remains whether this arousal responds to  treatment. Virtual reality (VR) has been posited to increase emotional engagement  during prolonged exposure therapy (PE) for PTSD by augmenting imaginal exposures  with trauma-relevant sensory information. However, the comparative effects of VR  exposure therapy (VRE) have received limited empirical inquiry. METHOD: Ninety  active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD participating in a  randomized-controlled trial to receive PE, VRE, or a waitlist-control (WL)  condition had their physiological reactivity, indexed by galvanic skin response  (GSR), to their trauma memories assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment.  RESULTS: Although both VRE and PE conditions showed reduced GSR reactivity to  trauma memories from pre- to posttreatment, only the VRE group differed  significantly from WL. Across the sample, reductions in GSR were significantly  correlated with reductions in self-reported PTSD and anxiety symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study comparing effects of VRE and PE on  psychophysiological variables. Given previous research finding limited  differences between VRE and PE in PTSD symptom reduction, these findings lend  support to the rationale for including VR in exposure therapy protocols while  raising important questions about the potential benefits of VRE.

Recently, innovative virtual reality (VR) training methods have been introduced  to enhance training efficiency. Image-based VR (IBVR), which incorporates  cognitive load, is theorized to improve task performance. However, the impact of  IBVR on learning outcomes requires further investigation. This study aims to  assess the efficacy of IBVR compared to textbook-based VR (TBVR) in teaching  operational skills to junior residents. METHODS: In a prospective cross-over  pilot study, ten volunteers were randomly assigned to either the IBVR-TBVR or  TBVR-IBVR group. Participants engaged in four learning sessions using either IBVR  or TBVR modules during the first phase. Performance was assessed using quizzes,  and Milestone/Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) ratings on real  patients. After one month, participants switched to the alternate VR module for  further training. Cognitive load and stress were assessed during each session  through questionnaires and heart rate variability (HRV). At the end of the study,  learning satisfaction, experience, and overall effectiveness were evaluated using  a global satisfaction scale, the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire, and group interviews.  Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic analysis framework. RESULTS: The  IBVR module yielded significantly better Milestone (p = 0.04), and DOPS  (p < 0.01) scores compared to TBVR. There were no significant differences in  knowledge gain, cognitive load, or HRV between the two modules. TBVR was favored  in terms of global satisfaction (p = 0.03), hedonic stimulation (p = 0.01), and  hedonic identification (p = 0.03), whereas IBVR was perceived as a more immersive  and enriching experience. The majority (70%) of participants reported a positive  experience with IBVR, while 50% expressed positive feedback regarding TBVR.  Thematic analysis identified two key themes: usability of instructional content  and ease of engagement. CONCLUSION: Although TBVR yielded higher learner  satisfaction and hedonic appeal, IBVR resulted in greater improvements in  operational performance and was positively received by most participants. This  proof-of-concept study highlights the complementary strengths of both VR  approaches and calls for further research to validate these preliminary findings  and inform the design of effective VR-based surgical education strategies.

However,  empirical evidence regarding its efficacy in addressing sleep disturbances  remains limited and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This 3-arm randomized controlled  trial aimed (1) to compare the efficacy of VR-based BF with conventional BF in  improving sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (PSQI), among individuals with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or both  (DAS); (2) to examine the effects of VR-based BF in a demographically similar  healthy control (HC) group; and (3) to evaluate between-group differences in  sleep quality improvements at the 4-week follow-up. METHODS: Participants scoring  ≥10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or ≥9 on the Panic Disorder Severity  Scale were allocated to a group with DAS while others were assigned to a HC  group. The DAS group was subsequently randomized into VR-based BF or conventional  BF interventions with a therapist. All participants attended sessions at weeks 0,  2, and 4, completing assessments including the Montgomery-Asberg Depression  Rating Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Visual Analog Scale in  interviews. The PSQI was administered at baseline and postintervention to  evaluate alterations in sleep quality over a 4-week period. RESULTS: A total of  118 participants were randomized into a VR-based BF group (DAS/VR, n=40) or a  conventional BF group (DAS/BF, n=38), and a control group (HC/VR, n=40) received  VR-based BF. Sleep disturbance scores of both DAS/VR and DAS/BF groups had  significant improvements (mean reductions of -0.58, SD 0.75 and -0.66, SD 0.75,  respectively) compared to those preintervention, showing no significant  difference after adjusting for age and sex (P=.49). The DAS/VR group had a  greater improvement in sleep disturbance (mean -0.08, SD 0.53; P=0.0014) than the  HC/VR group. Global PSQI scores in both DAS/VR and DAS/BF groups improved  compared to those preintervention, showing decreases by -2.50 (SD 2.89) and -3.39  (SD 2.80), respectively. The difference between the 2 groups was not  statistically significant (P=.14). The Global PSQI score in the DAS/VR group  showed significant improvement (-0.95, SD 2.09; P=.01) compared to that in the  HC/VR group. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that both VR-based BF and  conventional BF with a therapist are efficacious psychological interventions for  enhancing sleep quality in individuals with depressive symptoms, anxiety  symptoms, or both, with no significant differences observed between these 2  approaches. Both interventions showed significant improvements compared to  baseline measurements. These findings suggest potential applications of these  interventions in clinical settings to improve sleep quality and mental  well-being.","2025-06-20","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","e65772","","","27","","J Med Internet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© Sisu Seong, Hyewon Kim, Yaehee Cho, Min-Ji Kim, Ka Ram Park, Jooeun Choi, Seonah Lee, Dong Jun Kim, Seog Ju Kim, Hong Jin Jeon.

Among these, an emerging  approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for  anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no  systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of  psychological stress. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new  technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of  psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between  the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios  (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve  self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical  situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual  worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). METHODS: The study was designed as  a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two  different worker populations-teachers and nurses-that are highly exposed to  psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan  (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2:  n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1)  Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment  based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20,  which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive  behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20,  which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the  initial evaluation. RESULTS: Although both treatments were able to significantly  reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a  significant reduction (EG=12% vs. CG=0.5%) in chronic ""trait"" anxiety. A similar  pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly  increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant  increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better  outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress  treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and  rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced  protocols for psychological stress management.

The current study  aimed to compare biomarkers of response following two brief group interventions  for SAD. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of  single-session group interventions for SAD (n = 58) - imagery rescripting (IR)  and verbal restructuring (VR) versus waitlist control (WC). The IR intervention  guided participants to rescript autobiographical memories through visualization  whilst the VR intervention focused on thought challenging. Trial outcomes  included change in psychophysiological reactivity (heart rate variability (HRV)  and electrodermal responding) to social stress, and symptom-based measures  (social interaction anxiety, negative self-portrayal, cognitive avoidance,  repetitive negative thinking, memory modification, anxious behaviors). RESULTS:  Psychophysiological reactivity was selectively attenuated following IR treatment,  compared to VR and WC groups. The specific influence of the imagery-based  intervention in modulating autonomic reactivity was evident across HRV  parameters, including the standard deviation of intervals between heartbeats (IR  vs. WC, d = 0.67, p = 0.021; IR vs. VR, d = 0.58, p = 0.041), and high frequency  power - an indicator of parasympathetically mediated emotion regulation (IR vs.  WC, d = 0.75, p = 0.034; IR vs. VR, d = 0.95, p = 0.006). Few group differences  were observed across self-report measures. CONCLUSION: The current study  highlights the specificity of brief imagery-based interventions in influencing  psychophysiological reactivity in SAD and establishes the sensitivity of  objective markers of treatment response in quantifying change over symptom-based  measurements.","2018","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","340-349","","6","87","","Psychother Psychosom","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 S.

Hence, this  study set out to evaluate reactivity and habituation of self-reported stress and  HPA and SAM reactivity in a real TSST and VR-TSST when compared to a placebo  TSST. METHOD: Sixty-eight healthy young adults (50% female) were randomly  assigned to either a real TSST, a VR-TSST, or a placebo TSST, all of which were  conducted three times (one day and one week post initial exposure). Social  presence, self-reported stress, salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), and heart  rate variability (HRV) were analyzed using ANOVAs and multilevel models.  FINDINGS: On the first exposure, both the real and VR-TSST showed significantly  stronger cortisol and cardiovascular responses than the placebo. On the second  visit, the cortisol response was still significantly high-and the HRV response  low-for the real and VR-TSST. The third visit resulted in HR, HRV, and cortisol  responses comparable to the placebo group. Furthermore, the real TSST induced  more self-reported stress than the placebo on all three visits, the VR-TSST only  on the first two visits. Social presence was stable across conditions and had no  association with stress markers. CONCLUSION: These findings imply that the  replicability of stress exposures at shorter intervals seems problematic for the  traditional TSST, and for the VR-TSST.","2021-12-01","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","113618","","","242","","Physiol Behav","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational matched  study. MATERIALS & METHODS: Thirty-six orthopaedic surgery residents, new to  arthroscopy, received standard training in arthroscopic knee surgery,  supplemented by additional monthly training for 6months on a VR simulator for 16  of them. At inclusion, the 2 groups (VR and NON-VR) answered a questionnaire and  performed a meniscectomy on a VR simulator. After 6months of training, two  independent trainers blinded to the inclusion arms evaluated the technical skills  of the two groups during meniscectomies on a model and on an anatomical subject.  Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured using a wireless heart rate monitor  during baseline, VR training, and assessment. RESULTS: After removing incomplete  data, the analysis focused on 10 VR residents matched at inclusion with 10 NON-VR  residents. The VR group had a significantly lower heart rate at the final  assessment (p=0.02) and lower overall HRV (p=0.05). The low/high frequency ratio  (LF/HF) was not significantly different between the groups (1.84 vs 2.05, p=0.66)  but the before-after training comparison showed a greater decrease in this ratio  in the VR group compared to the NON-VR group -0.76 (-41%) vs -0.08 (-4%).  CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant difference in heart rate  variability between trained residents versus untrained residents during the final  assessment of their technical skills at 6months. It appears that improving stress  management should be an integral part of training programs in arthroscopic  surgery.

In response, highly  immersive virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments have been developed to  train clinical competencies. However, robust evidence on how VR-based methods  affect both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well as physiological and  perceived stress, remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the  effectiveness of VR-based simulation training, augmented with automated feedback,  compared with video seminars at improving emergency medical competency among  medical students. Furthermore, the study investigated the relationship between  learning outcomes and physiological stress markers. The evaluation of  participants' perceived stress and estimated learning success was also performed  to provide a more comprehensive insight into VR's potential role in emergency  training. METHODS: In total, 72 senior medical students underwent VR-based  emergency training (intervention) or viewed video seminars (control) on 2 topics  (acute myocardial infarction and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease) in an intraindividual crossover design. Levels of applied knowledge were  assessed objectively by open-response tests pre- and postintervention and after  30 days. In addition, 2 electrodermal activity markers representing physiological  stress response were measured during VR sessions using a wearable sensor.  Participants also rated their estimated learning success and perceived stress.  They also completed self-ratings of perceived stress and estimated learning  success. RESULTS: Short-term knowledge gains were comparable between the VR (mean  26.6%, SD 15.3%) and control (mean 27.2%, SD 16%) condition. However, VR training  produced significantly higher long-term knowledge gains (VR: mean 17.8%, SD 15.1%  vs control: mean 11.9%, SD 18%; difference: -5.9, 95% CI -11.5 to -0.4). Overall  retention scores were likewise higher for VR (mean 75.4%, SD 12.5%) than for  video-based learning (mean 69.0%, SD 14.5%), a difference that was more  pronounced in the myocardial infarction scenario. Participants rated the VR  format as significantly more effective (mean 4.83, SD 0.41, on a 5-point scale)  than the video seminar (mean 3.44, SD 1.00). While physiological stress markers  increased during VR sessions, their correlation with knowledge gains was weak and  negative. No significant relationship was detectable between perceived stress and  objective learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: VR-based simulation training with  automated feedback may offer long-term learning advantages over a traditional  video seminar in emergency-medicine education. Given the time constraints and  resource limitations of clinical education, self-moderated VR-based learning may  represent a valuable addition to conventional training methods. Future research  could investigate the learning effects of VR scenarios regarding the retention of  practical skills, as well as the impact of repeated or team-based scenarios.","2025-06-04","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","e67412","","","27","","J Med Internet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© Marco Lindner, Tobias Leutritz, Joy Backhaus, Sarah König, Tobias Mühling.

The primary aim of this  study was to examine whether military-specific virtual battle space (VBS)  scenarios could elicit a physiological and subjective stress response in healthy  military personnel, as compared to that of a virtual reality height exposure  (VR-HE) stress task that has shown to reliably increase stress levels. Twenty  participants engaged in two VBS scenarios and the VR-HE during separate sessions,  while measurements of heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), respiration  rate, and subjective stress levels were collected. Contrary to our initial  expectations, analysis revealed that neither of the VBS scenarios induced a  significant stress response, as indicated by stable HR, HRV, and low subjective  stress levels. However, the VR-HE task did elicit a significant physiological  stress response, evidenced by increased HR and HRV changes, aligning with  previous research findings. Moreover, no discernible alterations were detected in  cognitive performance subsequent to these stressors. These results suggest that  the current VBS scenarios, despite their potential, may not be effective for  stress-related training activities within military settings. The absence of a  significant stress response in the VBS conditions points to the need for more  immersive and engaging scenarios. By integrating interactive and demanding  elements, as well as physical feedback systems and real-time communication, VBS  training might better mimic real-world stressors and improve stress resilience in  military personnel. The findings of this study have broader implications for  stress research and training, suggesting the need for scenario design  improvements in virtual training environments to effectively induce stress and  improve stress management across various high-stress professions.","2024-12","2025-11-07 06:46:18","2025-11-07 06:46:18","","e3475","","6","40","","Stress Health","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 The Author(s).

All strategies led to decreases in parasympathetic  activity and increases in heart rate during anticipation. Parasympathetic  activity remained low in the recovery phase, while heart rate increased,  indicating a possible rebound effect of social performance. Exploratory  moderation analysis revealed that for subjects with higher social anxiety,  acceptance led to increased parasympathetic activity in the anticipation and  recovery phases than negative functional reappraisal.

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave  treatment (ESWT) in athletes with MTSS. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether one session  of focused ESWT is effective in the treatment of military cadets with MTSS.  DESIGN: A randomized, prospective, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group  clinical study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Ib. SETTING: Military School of Cadets of the  Colombian Army. METHODS: Forty-two military cadets with unilateral chronic MTSS  were randomly assigned to either one session of focused electromagnetic ESWT  (1500 pulses at 0.20 mJ/mm(2)) plus a specific exercise programme (muscle  stretching and strengthening exercises) or the exercise programme alone. The  primary endpoint was change in asymptomatic running test (RT) duration at four  weeks from baseline. Secondary endpoints were changes in the visual analogue  scale (VAS) after running and modified Roles and Maudsley (RM) score also at four  weeks from baseline. RESULTS: ESWT patients were able to run longer. Mean RT  after four weeks was 17 min 33 s (SE: 2.36) compared to 4 min 48 s (SE: 1.03) in  the exercise-only group (p = 0.000). Mean VAS after running was 2.17 (SE: 0.44)  in the ESWT group versus 4.26 (SE: 0.36) in the exercise-only group (p = 0.001).  The ESWT group had a significantly higher RM score, with excellent or good  results for 82.6% of patients vs. 36.8% in the exercise-only group (p = 0.002).  No significant adverse effects of ESWT were observed. CONCLUSION: A single  application of focused shockwave treatment in combination with a specific  exercise programme accelerates clinical and functional recovery in military  cadets with MTSS.","2017-10","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","102-109","","","46","","Int J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd.

METHODS: The clinical trial was conducted in the andrology  outpatient treatment room of the Department of Urology, Xiangya Hospital, Central  South University from August to November 2022 A total of 60 patients who met the  research criteria for comorbid ED combined with CP/CPPS were recruited and  randomly assigned to three treatment groups. They were treated with LIPUS (Group  A), drug therapy(Group B), and LIPUS combined with drug therapy (Group C),  respectively. Each group comprised 20 patients. Statistical analysis was  performed on the five-item version of International Index of Erectile Function  (IIEF-5), Erection Hardness Score (EHS), National Institutes of Health Chronic  Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire  (PHQ-9), the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the  incidence of adverse events to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety  of LIPUS. RESULTS: The positive response rate of ED and CP/CPPS treatment in  Group A is 40%(8/20) and 45%(9/20), while those in Group B is 55%(11/20) and  60%(12/20), and those in Group C is 85%(17/20) and 85%(17/20). A notable increase  in IIEF-5 scores was observed across the three groups post-treatment  (10.45 ± 2.50 vs. 13.65 ± 3.03, P = 0.008; 11.80 ± 3.21 vs. 16.40 ± 3.20,  P = 0.011; 12.90 ± 3.92 vs. 19.40 ± 2.35, P = 0.042) with a concomitant  significant decrease in NIH-CPSI scores (16.75 ± 4.53 vs. 14.65 ± 4.51,  P = 0.016; 16.35 ± 4.32 vs. 12.20 ± 4.74, P = 0.007; 16.00 ± 4.40 vs.  8.15 ± 4.28, P = 0.021). Notably, the most pronounced changes were seen in the  group receiving LIPUS combined with tadalafil and doxazosin. Additionally, all  groups exhibited marked improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms  post-treatment. No adverse events were observed during treatment. CONCLUSION:  LIPUS can improve erectile function and CP/CPPS symptoms with good safety, and  LIPUS combined with tadalafil and doxazosin is more effective during the  treatment. However, its long-term efficacy remains to be seen.

Acoustic therapy,  especially personalized acoustic therapy, plays an increasingly important role in  tinnitus treatment. With the application of smartphones, personalized acoustic  stimulation combined with smartphone apps will be more conducive to the  individualized treatment and management of patients with tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: The  aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new personalized approach  known as the digital frequency customized relieving sound (DFCRS) for tinnitus  treatment and to explore the factors that may influence its therapeutic effect.  METHODS: Patients with subjective tinnitus were enrolled in this study from July  14, 2020, to May 24, 2021, in the tinnitus specialist clinic of Eye and ENT  Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. In this nonrandomized concurrent  controlled trial, a total of 107 participants were assigned to listen to  personalized DFCRS through our developed app, while the other 77 participants who  did not want to download and use the app were assigned to listen to unmodified  music (UM). All the recruits were instructed to listen to DFCRS or UM for at  least 2 hours a day and complete follow-up assessments at baseline, 1, 2, and 3  months. Multidimensional assessment scales, that is, Tinnitus Handicapped  Inventory (THI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Athens Insomnia  Scale (AIS), Fear of Tinnitus Questionnaire (FTQ), and Tinnitus Catastrophizing  Scale (TCS) were used to evaluate the severity of tinnitus and the quality of  life. Linear mixed models were used to test for changes in the THI scores across  3 months of acoustic treatment between group (DFCRS or UM treatment) and time. A  multiclass logistic model was built with a stepwise function to determine the  influence of the different covariates on the effects of acoustic treatment.  RESULTS: The results of the multidimensional assessment scales after 3 months of  treatment showed that DFCRS-treated patients had significant tinnitus relief  compared to those in the UM group. Linear mixed models revealed a significant  reduction in the THI scores over time (P<.001), with the DFCRS group showing  significantly greater improvement than the UM group (P<.001). At 3 months, 92.5%  (99/107) of the patients undergoing DFCRS reported tinnitus relief or  disappearance, and longer daily treatment time was associated with better  outcomes (P=.007). Multiclass logistic regression confirmed that longer treatment  time (odds ratio [OR] 13.07-64.78; P<.001) and more severe tinnitus at baseline  (OR 10.46-83.71; P<.001) predicted better treatment response. All secondary  outcomes (HADS, AIS, FTQ, TCS) showed significant improvements over time  (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DFCRS is a new promising and  noninvasive therapy for chronic tinnitus, and it can be delivered through a  mobile app to bring more convenience to patients with tinnitus.","2025-01-17","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","e60150","","","27","","J Med Internet Res","","","","","","","","eng","©Dongmei Tang, Yuzhu Peng, Dantong Gu, Yongzhen Wu, Huawei Li.

In addition, it can provoke anxiety, stress, depression, and fatigue. The acoustic  therapies have become the most commonly applied treatment for tinnitus, either  self-administered or clinically prescribed. Binaural Sound Therapy (BST) and  Music Therapy (MT) aim to reverse the neuroplasticity phenomenon related to  tinnitus by adequately stimulating the auditory path-way. The goal of this  research is to evaluate the feasibility of applying BST for tinnitus treatment by  comparing its effect with MT effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 34 patients with  tinnitus from 29 to 60 years were informed about the experimental procedure and  consented their participation. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) MT and  2) BST. They applied their sound-based treatment for one hour every day along  eight weeks. Each treatment was adjusted to Hearing Loss (HL) and tinnitus  characteristics of each participant. To record EEG data, a bio-signal amplifier  with sixteen EEG channels was used. The system recorded data at a sampling  frequency of 256 Hz within a bandwidth between 0.1 and 100 Hz. RESULTS: The  questionnaire-monitoring reported that MT increased tinnitus perception in 30% of  the patients, and increased anxiety and stress in 8% of them. Regarding  EEG-monitoring, major neural synchronicity over the frontal lobe was found after  the treatment. In the case of BST reduced stress in 23% of patients.  Additionally, BST reduced tinnitus perception similar to MT (15% of patients).  With respect to EEG-monitoring, slightly major neural synchronicity over the  right frontal lobe was found after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MT should be  applied with caution since it could be worsening the tinnitus sufferer condition.  On the other hand, BST is recommended for tinnitus sufferers who have side  effects concerning stress but no anxiety.","2022-02","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","103248","","1","43","","Am J Otolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Fatigue  and exercise intolerance as prevalent symptoms experienced by patients with heart  failure can cause the loss of independence in the activities of daily living. It  can also damage self-care and increase dependence to others, which subsequently  can reduce the quality of life. This randomized controlled clinical trial was  conducted in an urban area of Iran in 2016. Samples were consisted of 105  hospitalized patients with heart failure chosen using a convenience sampling  method. They were assigned to relaxation, nature sounds, and control groups using  a randomized block design. In addition to routine care, the Benson muscle  relaxation and nature sounds groups received interventions in mornings and  evenings twice a day for 20 minutes within 3 consecutive days. A 9-item  questionnaire was used to collect data regarding fatigue before and after the  interventions. Relaxation and nature sounds reduced fatigue in patients with  heart failure in comparison to the control group. However, no statistically  significant difference was observed between the interventions. Benson muscle  relaxation and nature sounds are alternative methods for the reduction of fatigue  in patients with heart failure. They are inexpensive and easy to be administered  and upon patients' preferences can be used by nurses along with routine nursing  interventions.","2018-02","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","27-34","","1","32","","Holist Nurs Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29210875","","","","Nature; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Iran; *Muscle Relaxation; Fatigue/psychology/*therapy; Heart Failure/psychology/*therapy; Music Therapy/*methods/*standards; Quality of Life/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We need to try to replace it  with more non-invasive and effective treatments. The 2014 guidelines of the  American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recommend the use of  cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat tinnitus. Some clinical doctors have  also attempted sound therapy for tinnitus. It is unclear whether sound therapy  combined with CBT y is more effective than local injection of lidocaine and  methylprednisolone sodium succinate in treating tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate  the efficacy and influencing factors of refined sound therapy combined with CBT  in the treatment of tinnitus and compare it with post-auricular injection of  lidocaine and methylprednisolone sodium succinate. METHODS: We recruited 100  patients with tinnitus; ultimately, 81 patients completed the experiment and  underwent follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment  group (refined sound therapy combined with CBT) or the control group  (post-auricular injections of lidocaine and methylprednisolone sodium succinate).  Data was collected from 49 patients in the treatment group and 32 patients in the  control group. Pre- and post-treatment data were collected using the Self-Rating  Depression Scale (SDS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Visual Analogue  Score (VAS), Tinnitus loudness and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score.  Comparisons between groups were performed using the chi-square test, Fisher's  exact test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All tests were two-sided and considered  statistically significant with P < .05. RESULTS: The THI, SDS and HAM-A scores in  the treatment group decreased significantly. In the control group, there was a  significant reduction in THI scores, but not in SDS and HAM-A scores. In  addition, tinnitus loudness and VAS scores were significantly decreased in the 2  groups. There was a significant difference in the reduction of THI, SDS, HAM-A  and VAS scores between the 2 groups; the treatment group showed a greater  reduction. However, there was no significant difference in the reduction of  tinnitus loudness. There was no statistical difference in the reduction of THI  scores, SDS scores, VAS scores and tinnitus loudness in different frequency  groups, but there was a statistical difference in the reduction of HAM-A scores.  There was no statistical difference in the reduction of THI scores, SDS scores,  HAM-A scores, VAS scores and tinnitus loudness between patients with and without  hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: (1) This new combination is more effective than  post-auricular injection of lidocaine and methylprednisolone sodium succinate in  treating tinnitus and improving psychological symptoms. The latter had no effect  on improving psychological indicators. (2) With this combination, patients with  different tinnitus frequencies experienced different improvements in anxiety. (3)  Low-frequency tinnitus seems have been more likely to cause sound adaptation. (4)  The improvement in tinnitus and anxiety was the same regardless of whether or not  there was hearing loss.","2024-11","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","28-33","","11","30","","Altern Ther Health Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38518137","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; *Tinnitus/therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods; *Sound; Lidocaine/therapeutic use/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trial followed a previous pilot study that showed positive  results for Tele-PTM. DESIGN: Participants included individuals with bothersome  tinnitus (N = 205) located anywhere within the United States. A special emphasis  was given to including individuals who had experienced one or more traumatic  brain injuries (TBIs). Participants were randomized to either Tele-PTM  intervention or 6-month wait-list control (WLC). The Tele-PTM intervention  involved five telephone appointments-two led by an audiologist (teaching how to  use therapeutic sound) and three by a psychologist (teaching coping skills  derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy). It was hypothesized that Tele-PTM  would be more effective than WLC in reducing functional effects of tinnitus as  measured with the Tinnitus Functional Index. Additional outcome measures included  the Self-Efficacy for Managing Reactions to Tinnitus questionnaire and the  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The effect of Tele-PTM on outcomes was  estimated using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Overall results showed convincingly  that the Tele-PTM group had significantly better outcomes than the WLC group.  These results were consistent across all outcome measures, indicating not only a  reduction of tinnitus functional distress but also increased self-efficacy.  Improvements in measures of anxiety and depression were also observed. Tele-PTM  participants in all TBI categories showed significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS:  Results provide strong support for use of Tele-PTM methodology for persons with  bothersome tinnitus, regardless of whether the person also has TBI symptoms. The  effect size for Tele-PTM was high for the primary outcome measure, the Tinnitus  Functional Index, and all other outcome measures showed significant improvement.  Combined with our previous pilot study, the Tele-PTM method is validated for  potential nationwide provision of tinnitus services.","2019-04","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","227-242","","2","40","","Ear Hear","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29847413","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Self Efficacy; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods; Acoustic Stimulation/*methods; *Adaptation, Psychological; *Patient Education as Topic; *Telephone; Anxiety/psychology; Audiologists; Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications/*psychology; Case-Control Studies; Depression/psychology; Psychology; Telemedicine; Tinnitus/complications/psychology/*rehabilitation; Waiting Lists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is currently no high quality evidence to support any particular  intervention for MTSS. This study aims to investigate the effect of shockwave  therapy for MTSS. DESIGN: A randomized, sham-controlled, pilot trial in a  university-based health clinic including 28 active adults with MTSS. METHODS:  Intervention included standard dose shockwave therapy for the experimental group  versus sham dose for the control group, delivered during Week 1-3, 5 and 9. Main  outcome measures were pain measured during bone and muscle pressure as well as  during running using a numerical rating scale (0-10) and running was measured as  pain-limited distance (m), at Week 1 (baseline) and Week 10 (post-intervention).  Self-perception of change was measured using the Global Rating of Change Scale  (-7 to +7) at Week 10 (post-intervention). RESULTS: Pain (palpation) was reduced  in the experimental group by 1.1 out of 10.0 (95% CI -2.3 to 0.0) less than the  control group. There were no other statistically significant differences between  the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Standard dose shockwave therapy is not more effective  than sham dose at improving pain or running distance in MTSS. However, the sham  dose may have had a clinical effect. Further investigation including a no  intervention control is warranted to evaluate the effect of shockwave therapy in  the management of MTSS.","2017-03","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","220-224","","3","20","","J Sci Med Sport","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Sports Medicine Australia.

This study aimed to compare the  effects of nature sounds and reflexology on hemodynamic indices in traumatic  comatose patients. Methods This randomized clinical trial using a factorial  design was conducted on 120 traumatic comatose patients in two teaching hospitals  in two urban areas of Iran. The patients were selected using a sequential  sampling method and assigned into randomized quadruple blocks as control, nature  sounds, reflexology and nature sounds-reflexology (combined) groups. The  interventions were performed twice daily in two consecutive days lasting 30 min  each time. The hemodynamic indices were measured before, and immediately, 30 min,  and 2 h after the intervention using calibrated monitors. Descriptive and  inferential statistics, including one-way ANOVA, Scheffe ad hoc, repeated measure  ANOVA, Bonferroni ad hoc Chi-square test and Fisher's exact tests were used for  data analysis via the SPSS software V.16. Results Significant differences were  reported in terms of the mean arterial pressure between the control and  reflexology groups (p=0.002), and the combined group (p=0.008) immediately after  the interventions. The combined group showed statistically differences in  systolic blood pressure compared to the nature sounds (p=0.007) and control  (p=0.015) groups 30 min after the interventions. The nature sounds group showed  differences in the pulse rate from the reflexology (p=0.048) and control  (p=0.015) groups 30 min after the interventions in the second day. Conclusions  While the immediate effects of the interventions on induction of the feeling of  relaxation and tranquility, and reduction of hemodynamic indices were reported,  they diminished over time. Nature sounds and reflexology as low-cost and relaxing  tranquilizing methods can be used for the reduction of tension and improvement of  hemodynamic indices among traumatic comatose patients.","2019-02-06","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","/j/jcim.2019.16.issue-3/jcim-2018-0106/jcim-2018-0106.xml","","3","16","","J Complement Integr Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 30730838","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Sound; Heart Rate; nature sounds; *Acoustic Stimulation; *Musculoskeletal Manipulations; Blood Pressure; Coma/physiopathology/*therapy; hemodynamic indices; Hemodynamics; reflexology; traumatic comatose patients; Wounds and Injuries/physiopathology/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are  limited studies on its effectiveness for tinnitus. This study aimed to assess the  effectiveness of combining binaural beats with music containing nature sounds for  chronic tinnitus. METHODS: A total of 30 men, aged 45.87 on average (SD = 8.09),  who had chronic tinnitus and symmetrical mild to moderate hearing loss, were  included in this study. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: MT  group (Music therapy; n = 15), which received relaxing music containing the sound  of sea waves, and MT + BBS group (Music therapy plus binaural beats; n = 15),  which received the same music combined with alpha frequency (8 Hz) binaural  beats. The therapy sessions were conducted twice a day for 15 min, over a period  of 4 weeks. Outcome measures, including the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI),  Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the pitch and loudness of tinnitus were  administered before, immediately after, and during the three-month follow-up  period. RESULTS: The findings revealed improvements in loudness and annoyance  VAS, as well as THI total and all subscale scores in both groups (p < 0.001).  Additionally, TFI total score showed improvement in both groups (MT: p = 0.001;  MT + BBS: p < 0.001) except for the sense of control subscale in both groups and  the cognitive subscale in the MT group after the treatment and during the  three-month follow-up period. Furthermore, both groups exhibited a decrease in  scores for both subscales of HADS. However, there were no significant differences  between the two groups in any of the measurement outcomes (p > 0.05), except for  the emotional subscale scores of TFI (p = 0.049) and the functional subscale  scores of THI (p = 0.034). In other words, during the follow-up period, the  MT + BBS group exhibited lower scores in these two subscales compared to the MT  group. CONCLUSION: Although our study failed to demonstrate the superiority of  combining binaural beats with music, both groups experienced significant  improvements. This suggest that there are potential benefits to be gained from  these types of stimuli. Given the sustained effect of both methods and the even  greater improvements in follow-up observed in the binaural beats group for some  scales, it seems that the changes in neural response and brain waves caused by  our stimulations are persistent. This necessitates further research involving  brain mapping, especially with longer follow-up durations.","2024-08","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","104308","","4","45","","Am J Otolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Participants immersed one hand in  warm water for 2 min while exposed to noise, and changes in blood flow and skin  temperature of the non-immersed hand were observed. METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy  university students aged 20 years or older were randomly assigned to either the  hand-bathing group (n = 14) or the control group (n = 15). After a brief rest in  a quiet environment, participants were exposed to noise for 6 min. Those in the  hand-bathing group submerged their left hand in a 40°C thermostatic bath for 2  min, starting 2 min into the noise exposure. The tympanic temperature, blood  flow, and skin temperature of the non-immersed hand were continuously measured,  along with blood pressure and subjective evaluations before and after the noise  exposure. RESULTS: Both groups experienced a decrease in fingertip skin  temperature at the start of the noise exposure, persisting longer in the control  group. Conversely, the hand-bathing group showed increased fingertip skin  temperature after 150 s, significantly higher after the noise exposure than the  control group (p = .04). Participants in the hand-bathing group reported  significantly increased overall body warmth, thermal comfort, and relaxation  during hand-bathing (p = .007, p = .01, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The 2-min  hand-bathing intervention reversed the pronounced vasoconstrictive response  induced by noise exposure and elicited heightened sensations of overall body  warmth, thermal comfort, and relaxation. Hand-bathing may mitigate heightened  sympathetic nervous activity associated with psychological stress induced by  noise exposure.","2024-10","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","e12625","","4","21","","Jpn J Nurs Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 The Author(s).

The data were analyzed on SPSS version 22.00 for Windows software. The  independent groups t-test was applied to compare descriptive statistics such as  mean, standard deviation, number, and percentage in independent groups, while  categorical data were compared using the chi-square test. The effect of an  independent variable on a dependent variable was tested using linear regression  analysis. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The  study was completed with 32 experimental and 33 control group patients. There was  no significant difference in pre-intervention pain and anxiety between the  groups. The pain levels of the patients after the first and 12th cannulations  were significantly lower in the experimental group (p < 0.05). State and trait  anxiety levels were also significantly lower in the experimental group at the  12th session (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the sound of running water  has a significant positive effect on pain and anxiety experienced during  cannulation by dialysis patients. We recommend that clinicians apply such a  simple method as listening to the sound of running water for reducing pain and  anxiety during invasive procedures.","2025-02","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","42-51","","1","29","","Ther Apher Dial","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 International Society for Apheresis and Japanese Society for Apheresis.","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 39215434","","","","anxiety; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Sound; pain; *Anxiety/etiology/prevention & control; *Catheterization/methods; *Pain Measurement/methods; *Pain/etiology; *Renal Dialysis/methods/adverse effects; *Water; cannulation; hemodialysis; the sound of water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a major surgical procedure used in the  treatment of osteoarthritis. During this procedure the sounds of the saw and  hammer may irritate the patient and adversely affect mood. The present study  examines the effect of these intraoperative sounds during TKA on postoperative  mood and anxiety, by comparing two different anesthetic procedures. METHODS: A  total of 40 patients who underwent TKA for grade IV gonarthrosis participated in  the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: 20 patients in the  general anesthesia group and 20 patients in the spinal anesthesia group. Mood and  anxiety changes were evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) instruments, respectively. RESULTS: The  postoperative POMS value in the spinal anesthesia group was definitively higher  than the general anesthesia group, though the difference in preoperative and  postoperative POMS and STAI scores between the two groups was not significant.  CONCLUSION: It would seem that sounds of hammer and saw have no evident negative  effect on patient's mood. Regional anesthesia is advisable for TKA patients and  appropriate sedation can be administered during the operation if needed.","2015","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","690569","","","2015","","ScientificWorldJournal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25793222  PMCID: PMC4352437","","","","Affect; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Anxiety; Prospective Studies; Anesthesia, General; Anesthesia, Spinal; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*adverse effects/instrumentation/methods; Intraoperative Period; Osteoarthritis, Knee/surgery; Postoperative Period; Sound/*adverse effects; Surgical Instruments/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present experimental study investigated whether suggestions of nocebo  hyperalgesia modified the startle response and whether increased startle  contributed to the nocebo hyperalgesic effect. METHODS: A design with four groups  was employed; the participants were randomized into either a placebo group, a  natural history group, or into two nocebo groups. The participants in the placebo  and nocebo groups received suggestions of pain decrease or pain increase,  together with a placebo or nocebo cream applied to the lower arm, respectively.  Heat pain was induced by a PC-controlled thermode before and after the treatment.  White noise was used to elicit startle responses. Startle was assessed by  measuring eye blink electromyographic responses recorded from the right  orbicularis oculi muscle. RESULTS: The results showed that nocebo suggestions  increased reports of pain and startle responses. Increased startle was  significantly associated with the nocebo hyperalgesic response.

OBJECTIVES: To study whether the ASR relates  to symptom reduction in FMD patients, who participated in a placebo controlled  double blind treatment trial with Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT). METHODS: Response  to treatment in the BoNT study was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression  - Improvement scale (CGI-I). The electromyography (EMG) muscle activity of 7  muscles following 110 dB tones was measured in 14 FMD patients before and after  one-year treatment and compared to 11 matched controls. The early and a late  (behaviorally affected) component of the ASR and the sympathetic skin response  (SSR) were assessed. RESULTS: 10 of 14 patients (71.4%) showed symptom  improvement, which was believed to be mainly caused by placebo effects. The early  total response probability of the ASR at baseline tended to be larger in patients  compared to controls (p = 0.08), but normalized at follow-up (p = 0.84). The late  total response probability was larger in patients vs. controls at baseline  (p < 0.05), a trend that still was present at follow-up (p = 0.08). The SSR was  higher in patients vs. controls at baseline (p < 0.01), and normalized at  follow-up (p = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: On a group level 71.4% of the patients showed  clinical symptom improvement after treatment. The early part of the ASR, most  likely reflecting anxiety and hyperarousal, normalized in line with the clinical  improvement. Interestingly, the augmented late component of the ASR remained  enlarged suggesting persistent altered behavioral processing in functional  patients despite motor improvement.","2021-08","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","113-117","","","89","","Parkinsonism Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

Therefore, various treatment  protocols have been developed to reduce anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the  effects of music and white noise on patients' anxiety and pain during surgery for  impacted third molars. METHODS: According to the Consolidated Standards of  Reporting Trials statement, this single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with  parallel groups involved 66 patients who met the eligibility criteria and were  randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 listened to preselected songs  played against a pre-prepared standard ""white noise"" through noise-isolating  headphones that block ambient noise during the procedure. Group 2 listened only  to music through noise-isolating headphones during the procedure. Group 3  listened to natural ambient noise during the procedure. All surgical procedures  were performed in a standard operating room. All patients completed the  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S) form and indicated their anxiety on  a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) preoperatively and postoperatively. They also  indicated the pressure/pain level they felt during the procedure on a VAS. The  primary predictor variable was the music and white noise intervention. The  primary outcome variables were the STAI-S and VAS scores. Sex was included as a  covariate. RESULTS: Anxiety VAS scores were significantly lower postoperatively  than preoperatively in Groups 1 (p < 0.001), 2 (p < 0.001), and 3 (p = 0.002).  Similarly, STAI-S scores were significantly lower postoperatively than  preoperatively in Groups 1 (p < 0.001), 2 (p < 0.001), and 3 (p = 0.012). The  change in STAI-S scores (p = 0.053) did not differ significantly between groups.  CONCLUSION: Although not statistically significant, listening to music alone or  with white noise reduced the anxiety experienced by patients during the procedure  and increased their comfort. As a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive method,  listening to self-selected music in the preoperative and perioperative periods  could benefit patients.","2025-06-23","2025-11-07 06:46:42","2025-11-07 06:46:42","","506","","1","30","","Eur J Med Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2025.

Method Fifteen CI users and 14 normal-hearing (NH)  controls participated in an auditory lexical decision task (Experiment 1) and a  visual-world paradigm task (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 tested participants'  reliance on lexical statistics, and Experiment 2 studied how sentential context  affects the time course and patterns of lexical competition leading to lexical  access. Results In Experiment 1, CI users had lower accuracy scores and longer  reaction times than NH listeners, particularly for nonwords. In Experiment 2, CI  users' lexical competition patterns were, on average, similar to those of NH  listeners, but the patterns of individual CI users varied greatly. Individual CI  users' word-nonword sensitivity (Experiment 1) explained differences in the  reliance on sentential context to resolve lexical competition, whereas clinical  speech perception scores explained competition with phonologically related words.  Conclusions The general analysis of CI users' lexical competition patterns showed  merely quantitative differences with NH listeners in the time course of lexical  competition, but our additional analysis revealed more qualitative differences in  CI users' strategies to process speech. Individuals' word-nonword sensitivity  explained different parts of individual variability than clinical speech  perception scores. These results stress, particularly for heterogeneous clinical  populations such as CI users, the importance of investigating individual  differences in addition to group averages, as they can be informative for  clinical rehabilitation.

Noise and light in the ICU and the reduction in plasma  melatonin play the essential roles. The aim of this study was to determine the  effect of simulated ICU noise and light on nocturnal sleep quality, and compare  the effectiveness of melatonin and earplugs and eye masks on sleep quality in  these conditions in healthy subjects. METHODS: This study was conducted in two  parts. In part one, 40 healthy subjects slept under baseline night and simulated  ICU noise and light (NL) by a cross-over design. In part two, 40 subjects were  randomly assigned to four groups: NL, NL plus placebo (NLP), NL plus use of  earplugs and eye masks (NLEE) and NL plus melatonin (NLM). 1 mg of oral melatonin  or placebo was administered at 21:00 on four consecutive days in NLM and NLP.  Earplugs and eye masks were made available in NLEE. The objective sleep quality  was measured by polysomnography. Serum was analyzed for melatonin levels.  Subjects rated their perceived sleep quality and anxiety levels. RESULTS:  Subjects had shorter total sleep time (TST) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,  longer sleep onset latency, more light sleep and awakening, poorer subjective  sleep quality, higher anxiety level and lower serum melatonin level in NL night  (P <0.05). NLEE had less awakenings and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05).  NLM had longer TST and REM and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05). Compared  with NLEE, NLM had fewer awakenings (P = 0.004). Both NLM and NLEE improved  perceived sleep quality and anxiety level (P = 0.000), and NLM showed better than  NLEE in perceived sleep quality (P = 0.01). Compared to baseline night, the serum  melatonin levels were lower in NL night at every time point, and the average  maximal serum melatonin concentration in NLM group was significantly greater than  other groups (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with earplugs and eye masks,  melatonin improves sleep quality and serum melatonin levels better in healthy  subjects exposed to simulated ICU noise and light.

Due to the diversity of noise  sources present, including the operating noise of medical devices, staff  conversations and the unwrapping of disposables, noise profiles are varied.  Psychoacoustics deals with the analysis of sound, focusing on its effects on  physiological perception and stress. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to  examine and to classify noise and its psychoacoustic properties in different  locations in our ICU at different times. The impact of noise on subjective  parameters and stress-related physiological data was also assessed with and  without interventional methods. DESIGN: A randomised, controlled, single-blinded  clinical trial. SETTING: University Hospital, from November 2010 to May 2011.  PATIENTS: One hundred and forty-four patients in the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: In the  first part, multidisciplinary psychoacoustic measurement was performed on the  patients in our ICU. In the subsequent clinical trial, patients were equipped  with effective earplugs, less effective earplugs and no earplugs. Thereafter,  active noise cancellation headphones with or without sound masking were employed  on a third patient population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortisol and α-amylase in  saliva, skin conductance measures, vital signs, psychoacoustic analyses and two  standardised questionnaires [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Hospital  Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] were assessed. RESULTS: In the first part,  the mean ± standard deviation (SD) subjective loudness was 9.2 ± 4.0 sone.  Although absolute sound pressure level and loudness were lower during the night,  the number of loud events increased significantly. Skin conductance in the  earplug groups was significantly reduced in comparison to that in the control  population but not the active noise reduction groups. Nevertheless, noise  reduction was found to be comfortable for most patients. CONCLUSION: Noise in the  ICU is of high clinical relevance. Diverse noise reduction methods, such as  earplugs and active noise cancellation, are available. The avoidance of  unnecessary noise, however, should be the primary focus.

We sought to investigate whether the  preoperative use of binaural beats could reduce the propofol dose for the  induction of general anesthesia. METHODS: We enrolled patients scheduled for  elective surgery under general anesthesia in a randomized controlled trial. In  the preoperative waiting area, we randomized patients to hear the binaural beats  with frequencies of 432 and 431 Hz in the binaural-beats group (N = 34) or silent  sound in the control group (N = 35) for 20 min via stereo headphones. For the  induction of general anesthesia, we administered 10 mg of propofol every 15 sec  until we observed three clinical signs: the loss of response to verbal commands  of ""open your eyes"" (primary outcome), loss of eyelash reflex, and a patient  state index of ≤ 50. We collected processed frontal electroencephalography data  during the intervention and assessed anxiety scores before and after the  intervention. RESULTS: The propofol dose for the loss of response to verbal  commands was lower in the binaural-beats group than in the control group (mean  [standard deviation], 87 [24] mg vs 105 [32] mg; difference in means, -18 mg; 95%  confidence interval, -32 to -5; P = 0.009). There were no significant differences  in the delta (P = 0.63), theta (P = 0.28), alpha (P = 0.24), and beta (P = 0.85)  bands of the processed frontal electroencephalograms and the anxiety scores  (P = 0.50). CONCLUSION: Binaural beats with a frequency of 1 Hz modestly reduced  the propofol dose for the induction of general anesthesia, but we observed no  significant differences in the processed frontal electroencephalograms and  preoperative anxiety levels.

While complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a growing system of practices in the treatment of  health and mental-health conditions, many individuals have limited access to  mind-body interventions. Creating accessible stress-inoculation strategies may  augment traditional mental-health interventions and services. OBJECTIVE: This  pilot study intended to assess the effectiveness of a theta binaural beat (TBB)  auditory stimulus on heart rate and self-reported stress, which was  experimentally induced by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). DESIGN: The  repeated measures study compared the stress levels after a stimulus and stressor  for two groups, within an experimentally induced psychological stress paradigm,  the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). SETTING: The study occurred at a private  Midwestern university. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 64 US adults recruited  from undergraduate classes at the university, with a mean age of 19 years and a  range from 18 to 30. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to the  intervention or the control group. The intervention group listened to pink sound,  carrier tones, and embedded TBB, while the control group listened to pink sound  and carrier tones without embedded TBB. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed  self-report assessments about the auditory stimulus, perceived stress, and  mindfulness and then engaged in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).  Subsequently, they completed measures on perceived stress using a visual analogue  scale (VAS), and heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded throughout the study.  RESULTS: With respect to the evaluation of subjective stress using the VAS,  psychological stress increased significantly between the exposure to the stimuli  and the TSST-F(1.28, 53) = 42.76, P = .01, partial η2 = 0.44. The change in  stress levels for the intervention group, however, was not significantly  different from that of the control group at any time point F(1.28, 53) = 1.03, P  = .33, partial η2 = 0.02. With respect to the evaluation of physiological  response to stress using the HRV, the changes in HF HRV between the 4,  five-minute segments during stimulus exposure were not significantly different  between the groups F(3, 55) = 0.90, P = .44, partial η2 = 0.02. A significantly  greater change-F(1, 55) = 4.84, P = .03 partial η2 = 0.08-in the HF HRV occurred  over the TSST period for the intervention group compared to the control group  suggesting that on average across the TSST stress tasks, those in the  intervention group demonstrated higher HF signals. CONCLUSIONS: The current study  found that the intervention group, who listened to TBBs, had greater  parasympathetic dominance during TSST than the control group. This suggests that  TBB exposure may dampen subsequent stress responses to an acute, psychological  stressor. This finding, however, should be interpreted with caution, because  further research and independent replication are warranted.","2021-07","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","28-33","","4","27","","Altern Ther Health Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32619206","","","","Adult; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Pilot Projects; *Hydrocortisone; *Stress, Psychological/therapy; Heart Rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Virtual reality has been studied for its sedative and analgesic effects, as  it immerses the patient into an artificial interactive environment. Deriving from  this concept, we hypothesized that an immersive experience that engulfs the  senses with noninteractive visual and auditory stimuli would have a positive  effect on satisfaction and anxiety in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.  METHODS: We enrolled and randomized 90 patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for  arthroscopic knee surgery into an immersive experience arm and an intravenous  midazolam sedation arm. The immersive experience was provided through a mobile  phone-based head-mounted display showing binocular monoscopic video and  noise-canceling headphones playing audio. The primary outcome measure was  postoperative satisfaction, measured using a visual analog scale and compared  using the Mann-Whitney U test; secondary outcomes included anxiety score  (measured using the 6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), hemodynamic stability,  and additional sedative requirement. RESULTS: The visual analog scale  satisfaction score with immersive experience was significantly higher than with  midazolam (median [interquartile range {IQR}] of 93 [82-98] and 80 [73-93],  respectively, P = .004), with Hodges-Lehmann median difference estimate of 7 (95%  confidence interval, 3-14). The change in anxiety scores from the preoperative to  postoperative period between the groups was not significantly different (P =  .08), with a Hodges-Lehmann median difference estimate of 3.3 (95% confidence  interval, 0-6.7). All patients were hemodynamically stable, were without  significant adverse events, and did not require additional sedatives.  CONCLUSIONS: We have found that an immersive experience is an effective and  acceptable intraoperative alternative to pharmacological sedation in patients  undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under spinal anesthesia, with higher  satisfaction levels and no detected difference in preoperative to postoperative  anxiolytic effect.","2021-10-01","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","940-948","","4","133","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 International Anesthesia Research Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34283040","","","","*Virtual Reality; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Time Factors; Young Adult; Treatment Outcome; Prospective Studies; Photic Stimulation; *Patient Satisfaction; Acoustic Stimulation; *Anesthesia, Spinal/adverse effects; *Arthroscopy/adverse effects; *Cell Phone; *Smart Glasses; Administration, Intravenous; Anxiety/etiology/*prevention & control/psychology; Hypnotics and Sedatives/administration & dosage; India; Knee Joint/*surgery; Midazolam/administration & dosage; Pain Management/adverse effects/*instrumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the AVS effects were  highly similar whether binaural beats were present or not and regardless of the  duration of experience. Remarkably, the mood benefits from AVS closely aligned  with those achieved through breath-focused meditation with additional evidence  that a brief AVS exposure of approximately five minutes may be sufficient or even  optimal for improving mood to a comparable or greater degree than meditation  sessions of equal or longer durations (11-22 min).

Visual analogue scale pain score and hospital anxiety depression scale  scores were used to measure outcome. The recruited patients were asked to submit  an anticipated visual analogue scale pain score prior to treatment as well as the  actual experienced post-operative visual analogue scale pain score. RESULTS:  There was no significant difference between the AVD- and AVD+ groups  post-operative pain score 2.85 (SD 1.7) versus 2.60 (SD 2.3), p = 0.68.

In Parkinson disease (PD), gait impairments often coexist with nonmotor symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Biofeedback training may  improve gait function in PD, but its effect on nonmotor symptoms remains unclear.  This study explored the cognitive and global effects of Ambulosono, a cognitive  gait training method utilizing step size to contingently control the real-time  play of motivational music. Objective. This study examined the feasibility of  music-contingent gait training and its effects on neuropsychological test  performance and mood in persons with PD. Methods. A total of 30 participants with  mild to moderate PD were semirandomized via sequential alternating assignment  into an experimental training group or control music group. The training group  received 12 weeks of music-contingent training, whereby music play was dependent  on the user achieving a set stride length, adjusted online based on individual  performance. The control group received hybrid training beginning with 6 weeks of  noncontingent music walking, whereby music played continuously regardless of step  size, followed by 6 weeks of music-contingent training. Global cognition, memory,  executive function, attention, and working memory assessments were completed by  blinded assessors at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Motor function, mood, and  anxiety were assessed. Results. Average training adherence was 97%, with no falls  occurring during training sessions. Improvements on cognitive measures were not  clinically significant; however, significant decreases in depression and anxiety  were observed in both groups over time (P < .05). Conclusions. Music-contingent  gait training is feasible and safe in individuals with PD. Further investigation  into potential therapeutic applications of this technology is recommended.","2020-01","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","82-92","","1","34","","Neurorehabil Neural Repair","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31878824","","","","Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Feasibility Studies; Follow-Up Studies; *Music; Single-Blind Method; Acoustic Stimulation; *Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; *Psychomotor Performance/physiology; auditory stimulation; cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction/etiology/*rehabilitation; Exercise Therapy/*methods; external cueing; gait disorders; Gait Disorders, Neurologic/etiology/*rehabilitation; music training; neurologic; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson disease; Parkinson Disease/complications/*rehabilitation; Severity of Illness Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-arm multicenter prospective trial  to assess safety and efficacy of the ESMR therapy in patients with refractory  angina (class III/IV angina) was performed. Screening exercise treadmill tests  and pharmacological single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were  performed for all patients to assess exercise capacity and ischemic burden.  Patients were treated with 9 sessions of ESMR to ischemic areas over 9 weeks.  Efficacy end points were exercise capacity by using treadmill test as well as  ischemic burden on pharmacological SPECT at 4 months after the last ESMR  treatment. Safety measures included electrocardiography, echocardiography,  troponin, creatine kinase, and brain natriuretic peptide testing, and pain  questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with medically refractory angina and no  revascularization options were enrolled. There was a statistically significant  mean increase of 122.3±156.9 seconds (38% increase compared with baseline; P=.01)  in exercise treadmill time from baseline (319.8±157.2 seconds) to last follow-up  after the ESMR treatment (422.1±183.3 seconds). There was no improvement in the  summed stress perfusion scores after pharmacologically induced stress SPECT at 4  months after the last ESMR treatment in comparison to that at screening; however,  SPECT summed stress score revealed that untreated areas had greater progression  in ischemic burden vs treated areas (3.69±6.2 vs 0.31±4.5; P=.03). There was no  significant change in the mean summed echo score from baseline to posttreatment  (0.4±5.1; P=.70). The ESMR therapy was performed safely without any adverse  events in electrocardiography, echocardiography, troponins, creatine kinase, or  brain natriuretic peptide. Pain during the ESMR treatment was minimal (a score of  0.5±1.2 to 1.1±1.2 out of 10). CONCLUSION: In this multicenter feasibility study,  ESMR seems to be a safe and efficacious treatment for patients with refractory  angina pectoris. However, larger sham-controlled trials will be required to  confirm these findings.","2014-03","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","346-354","","3","89","","Mayo Clin Proc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

This study evaluates the impact of perioperative music interventions  on mitigating anxiety and hemodynamic responses. PURPOSE: To explore the  influence of various music genres on anxiety and blood pressure (BP) levels in  patients undergoing IVI at the day-surgery center. METHODS: This study was a  randomized controlled trial involving 130 patients who were scheduled to receive  IVI. The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the binaural  beat group (n = 31), the Chinese music group (n = 33), the Western music group  (n = 31), and the control group (n = 35). Patients in the music groups were  provided with in-ear headphones and received corresponding musical interventions  in the waiting room and throughout the surgery, while the control group did not  receive any special interventions. Before the operation, all participants  completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) questionnaire, systolic BP  (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and pulse rate (PR) were measured, which were measured  during and after surgery as well. After the IVI operation, the STAI-S  questionnaire was again filled out completely. RESULTS: The cohort (59.2 %  female; mean age 62.22 ± 12.71 years) exhibited baseline measures of STAI-S  (39.38 ± 5.77), SBP (148.88 ± 19.67 mmHg), DBP (81.82 ± 10.93 mmHg), and PR  (82.97 ± 11.53 bpm). Post-intervention, significant reductions in STAI-S scores  occurred in the binaural beats group (-7.23 ± 3.83; P < 0.001 vs control) and  Chinese music group (-4.12 ± 5.02; P = 0.018 vs control), while the binaural  beats group uniquely attenuated SBP elevation (intraoperative: P = 0.019;  postoperative: P < 0.005 vs other groups). No significant changes emerged in DBP  or pulse rate across groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Among the Chinese population,  both binaural beats and Chinese music were found to significantly reduce anxiety  levels in patients receiving IVIs. Furthermore, the binaural beats group  exhibited a decrease in systolic blood pressure during and after the procedure.  Music therapy may be potentially advantageous for improving the perioperative  period of IVIs in patients. In the future, the combined magic of music therapy  and ophthalmic surgery should be explored to reduce anxiety in patients with  ophthalmic diseases themselves.","2025-08","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","105264","","","258","","Acta Psychol (Amst)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) can be defined as the stimulation of the  senses in a periodic manner within a range of low frequencies. Music plus sound  delivered through a vibroacoustic device is a form of RSS and has demonstrated  utility in managing pain. In this current study, we conducted an open-label pilot  study of 15 patients with hypermobile EDS using RSS as the intervention.  Posttreatment improvements were seen in 11 of the 15 patients (73%), whereas 3 of  the 15 patients (20%) experienced worse outcomes. Of the 14 patients that  completed the experiment, 6 participants (43%) were classified as ""responders"" to  the device while 8 participants (57%) were classified as ""nonresponders.""  Responders demonstrated significant improvements in pain interference (51.5 ± 16  preintervention vs. 43.5 ± 16.4 postintervention BPI score) and depression  symptoms (34.0 ± 15.9 preintervention vs. 26.8 ± 12.1 postintervention CESD  score). Poststudy interviews confirm the improvements of pain interference, mood,  and bowel symptoms. Furthermore, analysis of medical conditions within the  responder group indicates that the presence of depression, anxiety, irritable  bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia may indicate a greater likelihood for patients  to benefit with vibroacoustic applications. These results indicate a possible  potential for RSS, delivered using a vibroacoustic device, in managing  pain-related symptoms. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact  mechanism behind the physiological benefits of RSS.","2020","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","3586767","","","2020","","Pain Res Manag","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Veronica Vuong et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32399126  PMCID: PMC7204284","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pain Management/*methods; Pilot Projects; Acoustic Stimulation/*methods; Chronic Pain/*etiology/*therapy; Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/*complications; Vibration/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients from San Juan de Dios Hospital with  displaced nasal fractures who required a reduction and assigned them to a control  group or a music group. For both groups, a protocolized closed reduction of the  nasal fracture with local anesthesia was performed. The music group heard music  through headphones during the pre-, intra-, and postprocedural periods of the  intervention. Physiological variables (blood pressure and heart rate) were  measured. An anxiety survey (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and the visual analog  scale for measuring pain were also applied. RESULTS: The music group exhibited  significantly lower levels of systolic blood pressure (P = .0001), anxiety (P <  .0001), and pain (P = .0004) than the control group. CONCLUSION: Listening to  music through headphones-a safe and low-cost intervention-appears to aid in pain  and anxiety management associated with procedures that are usually uncomfortable,  such as the reduction of nasal bone fractures with local anesthesia. We believe  that this effect is achieved by the modulation of pain and anxiety on an  emotional-affective dimension at a central level. Given its safety, feasibility,  and low cost, music therapy should be considered a complementary treatment for  pain and anxiety management for nasal fracture reduction performed with local  anesthesia, as well as for other medical procedures of similar pain levels  conducted without general anesthesia.","2019-10","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","613-619","","4","161","","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31184266","","","","music; anxiety; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Pain Measurement; Anxiety/*prevention & control; pain; Heart Rate; Blood Pressure; *Fracture Fixation/adverse effects/psychology; *Music Therapy; Fractures, Bone/*therapy; music therapy; Music/*psychology; Nasal Bone/*injuries; nasal fracture; Pain/etiology/*prevention & control; reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, we found that anxiety self-report scores  correlated negatively with average gamma activity within the insula within each  group. The convergence of self-reported data and quantitative EEG data was  consistent across 27 participants.

METHODS: A  single-arm multicenter prospective study was designed aiming to determine the  safety and efficacy of ESMT. Patients of functional Canadian Cardiovascular  Society class II-IV, despite stable and optimal medical management, with  documented myocardial segments with reversible ischemia and/or hibernation on the  basis of echocardiography/single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)  were enrolled from 2010 to 2012. A total of 111 patients were enrolled, 33 from  Indonesia, 21 from Malaysia, and 57 from Philippines. Patients underwent nine  cycles of ESMT over 9 weeks. Patients were followed up for 3-6 months after ESMT  treatment. During follow-up, patients were subjected to clinical evaluation, the  Seattle Angina Questionnaire, assessment of nitrate intake, the 6-min walk test,  echocardiography, and SPECT. RESULTS: The mean age of the population was  62.9±10.9 years. The summed difference score on pharmacologically induced stress  SPECT improved from 9.53±17.87 at baseline to 7.77±11.83 at follow-up (P=0.0086).

This capacity may diminish with use and result in self-regulatory depletion (SRD), or  the reduced ability to engage in future SR efforts. If the SRD effect applies to  vocal behavior, it may hinder success during behavioral voice treatment. Thus,  this proof-of-concept study sought to determine whether SRD affects vocal  behavior change and if so, whether it can be repaired by an intervention meant to  replete SR resources. METHODS: One hundred four women without voice disorders  were randomized into groups that performed either (1) a high-SR writing task  followed by a high-SR voice task; (2) a low-SR writing task followed by a high-SR  voice task; or (3) a high-SR writing task followed by a relaxation intervention  and a high-SR voice task. The high-SR voice tasks in all groups involved  suppression of the Lombard effect during reading and free speech. RESULTS: The  low-SR group suppressed the Lombard effect to a greater extent than the high-SR  group and high-SR-plus-relaxation group on the free speech task. There were no  significant group differences on the reading task. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest  that SRD may present challenges to vocal behavior modification during free speech  but not reading. Furthermore, relaxation did not significantly replete  self-regulatory resources for vocal modification during free speech. Findings may  highlight potential considerations for voice treatment and assessment and support  the need for future research focusing on effective methods to test  self-regulatory capacity and replete self-regulatory resources in voice patients.","2016-09","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","638.e21-31","","5","30","","J Voice","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26804788","","","","Female; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Treatment Outcome; Cognition; Surveys and Questionnaires; Noise/adverse effects; *Phonation; *Self-Control; *Speech Acoustics; *Voice Quality; *Voice Training; Acoustics; Attention; Lombard effect; Reading; Self-regulatory depletion; Self-regulatory repletion; Sound Spectrography; Speech Production Measurement; Voice Disorders/diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy; Voice therapy; Wisconsin; Writing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple lines of  evidence suggest an important role for the noradrenergic system in the generation  of the P3. However, pharmacological studies of the P3 using noradrenergic  manipulations have so far been limited to agents that affect α2-receptor  signaling. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether β-adrenergic  receptors are involved in the generation of the P3 and the error positivity (Pe),  a component of the event-related potential that is elicited by errors and that  bears many similarities to the P3. METHODS: We used a double-blind,  placebo-controlled, crossover design in which we examined in human participants  (N = 16) the effect of a single dose of propranolol (80 mg) on the amplitudes of  the P3 observed in visual and auditory oddball tasks and the Pe observed in a  flanker task. RESULTS: We found that P3s to auditory stimuli were increased in  amplitude following treatment with propranolol. Propranolol also modulated the P3  to visual stimuli, but in a direction dependent on participants' level of trait  anxiety: In participants with lower trait anxiety, propranolol resulted in a  (non-significant) decrease in P3 amplitudes; in participants with higher trait  anxiety, propranolol significantly enhanced P3 amplitude. Propranolol did not  modulate the amplitude of the Pe or behavioral measures of conflict/error-related  performance adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence  for involvement of β-adrenergic receptors in P3 generation. We speculate that  propranolol affected the P3 through actions at β2-receptors in the locus  coeruleus.","2015-09","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","3161-3172","","17","232","","Psychopharmacology (Berl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 26138780  PMCID: PMC4534504","","","","Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Double-Blind Method; Young Adult; Photic Stimulation; Anxiety/psychology; Acoustic Stimulation; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology; Electroencephalography/drug effects; Event-Related Potentials, P300/drug effects; Evoked Potentials/*drug effects; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Propranolol/pharmacology; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, population-level benefit is constrained by both inequitable  access to high-quality natural spaces and the lack of medical prescriptions for  nature-based therapy. Addressing these challenges requires an improved  understanding of the mechanisms linking environmental attributes to positive  health outcomes. A systematic, standardised experimental approach is needed to  support this effort. This manuscript presents two complementary experiments-a  randomised controlled trial (n = 100) and a counterbalanced crossover trial  (n = 30)-designed to assess the effect of a 30-min exposure to forest and  industrial acoustic environments on selected biomarkers. This is the first in a  series of laboratory experiments which isolate and expose individual senses to  natural and industrial stimuli, while measuring biological parameters previously  shown to respond positively to whole-body, real-world, nature immersion. Forest  acoustics (recorded in a UK temperate rainforest, featuring bird song, running  water, wind and rainfall) significantly improved biomarkers of mood, restoration  and cognition, relative to industrial acoustics (recorded in Liverpool and London  city centre), but not heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability,  salivary cortisol or secretory Immunoglobulin A. These findings suggest that  acoustic elements of forest environments play a role in mediating enhanced  psychological state and cognition but do not appear to influence physiological  stress or immunological parameters. This work advances understanding of how  nature influences human biology and takes steps towards addressing existing  challenges to nature-based therapy. In the short-term, these findings highlight  the potential of acoustic interventions for individuals with limited access to  nature.","2025-09-30","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","33967","","1","15","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2025.

During general anesthesia, binaural beat (BB)  listening has been found to reduce intraoperative fentanyl consumption as well as  postoperative pain scores and discharge time. Auditory BBs are a perceptual  phenomenon occurring when tones of 2 slightly different frequencies are presented  simultaneously and separately to each ear. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to  evaluate the ability of BBs, as a nonpharmacological premedication, to reduce  postoperative morphine consumption in older adults undergoing total knee  replacement surgery and to modify the levels of anxiety and feelings of pain that  patients experience. DESIGN: The research team designed a prospective,  single-center, randomized controlled study. SETTING: The study was conducted in  the Orthopedic Department of the Santa Maria Maddalena Hospital (Volterra [Pisa],  Italy). PARTICIPANTS: Forty older adults at the hospital who were undergoing  total knee joint replacement with spinal anesthesia participated in the study.  INTERVENTION: The study included 2 groups (n = 20 each), one receiving BBs  stimulation with frequencies of 256 Hz in one ear and 260 Hz in the opposite ear  producing a BB of 4 Hz (intervention group), and the other receiving acoustical  stimulation at 256 Hz in both ears (control group). BBs, or acoustical  stimulation, were administered before the surgical procedure. Both acoustical  stimuli, generated with the Gnaural program, were delivered through stereo  headphones connected to a laptop in the preoperative holding area. OUTCOME  MEASURES: The study measured postoperative, cumulative, self-administered  morphine consumption, in mg, through a patient-controlled analgesia device.  Feelings of anxiety were also assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,  and feelings of pain were measured every 8 h during the first postoperative day  using a numerical rating scale. RESULTS: Patients who received the intervention,  consumed almost half of the dosage of morphine during the first postoperative day  when compared with the control group's consumption, 5.75 mg ± 5.25 vs 11.85 mg ±  7.71, respectively. The consumption did not correlate to anxiety measures.  Regarding pain perception, no differences between the groups were captured.  CONCLUSIONS: BB stimulation before surgery can be successfully used as a  nonpharmacological treatment to reduce morphine consumption in older adults who  undergo knee replacement. The use of a noninvasive, safe, and inexpensive BB  intervention can result in a positive effect on patients' postoperative recovery.","2021-03","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","27-30","","2","27","","Altern Ther Health Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32412916","","","","Humans; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Prospective Studies; *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; *Morphine/therapeutic use; Italy; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, no prior study  involved preprocedure binaural music exposure among patients undergoing upper  gastrointestinal endoscopy, and this study sought to investigate its effect on  anxiety and tolerance among participants undergoing sedation-free upper  gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods: The prospective, controlled, randomized  trial included the participation of 96 Turkish patients aged between 18 and 70  years who were scheduled for an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, regardless of  sex or illness, and were divided randomly into two different groups to undergo  endoscopy, namely, the binaural beats group (n = 48) and a control group (n =  48). Patients in the binaural beat music group wore headphones, and music was  given 15 mins before endoscopy; however, no particular treatment was given for  either group. Anxiety levels were assessed by using the State Trait Anxiety  Inventory questionnaire, in addition to changes before and after endoscopy to  measure patient satisfaction based on the physician's recorded numbers of retches  noted by doctors as tolerance was documented and compared among both groups.  Results: The results showed that following this procedure, in the music group,  state scores remained significantly lower than before them (p = 0.016), compared  with the control group (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference regarding  changes in diastolic or systolic heart rate or blood pressure (p > 0.05).  However, the procedure tolerance and satisfaction scores were significantly  higher in the music group than those without music (p < 0.05). Conclusion: For  patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, music with binaural beats  was found to significantly reduce anxiety levels and increase patient tolerance,  providing an alternative option to sedative medications as a potential sedative  treatment option.Clinical trials registration number: NCT06114524.","2024-12","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","1209-1216","","12","30","","J Integr Complement Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 39088370  PMCID: PMC11659431","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Aged; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Turkey; Prospective Studies; *Anxiety/therapy; Patient Satisfaction; Music/psychology; *Music Therapy/methods; binaural beats; *Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/methods; anxiety reduction; gastrointestinal endoscopy; nonpharmacological intervention; sedation-free procedures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A double-blinded, randomized, pre- and postintervention trial.  METHODS: Seventy-four military services members with complaint of postdeployment  stress were randomized to either music with BBT or music alone. Each group  listened to their respective intervention for a minimum of 30 min at bedtime for  three consecutive nights a week for a total of 4 weeks. A 20-min pre- and  postintervention heart rate variability (HRV) stress test and daily perceived  stress via diaries assessed intervention efficacy. FINDINGS: There was a  statistical difference (p = .01) in low-frequency HRV between the music with BBT  group compared to the music only group. The average low-frequency HRV decreased  in the music with BBT group 2.5 ms(2) /Hz, while in the music only group it  increased 7.99 ms(2) /Hz. There was also a significant difference (p = .01) in  the high-frequency HRV measures, with the music with BBT group showing an  increase in HRV by 2.5 ms(2) /Hz compared to the music only group, which  decreased by 7.64 ms(2) /Hz. There were significant (p = .01) differences found  in total power measures, with the music only group decreasing by 1,113.64 ms(2)  /Hz compared to 26.68 ms(2) /Hz for the music with BBT group. Finally, daily  diaries consistently showed that participants who used BBT reported less stress  over the course of the 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: When placed under an acute stressor,  participants who used music with embedded BBT showed a decrease in sympathetic  responses and an increase in parasympathetic responses, while participants who  used music alone had the opposite effect. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of BBT in  the theta brainwave frequency embedded into music decreases physical and  psychological indications of stress. BBT embedded with beta and delta frequencies  may improve cognitive functioning and sleep quality, respectively.","2017-07","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","411-420","","4","49","","J Nurs Scholarsh","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 Sigma Theta Tau International.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28544507","","","","heart rate variability; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Prospective Studies; Heart Rate/*physiology; Acoustic Stimulation/*methods; Music Therapy/*methods; Binaural beat technology; military; Military Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; postdeployment stress; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*physiopathology/psychology/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled study in which rhythmic binaural  beats and control were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced  sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). Patients ([Formula: see  text], age [Formula: see text], stage I-III Hoehn & Yahr scale) participated in  two sessions of sound stimulation for 10[Formula: see text]min separated by a  minimum of 7 days. Data were collected immediately before and after both  stimulations with the following results: (1) a decrease in theta activity, (2) a  general decrease in Functional Connectivity (FC), and (3) an improvement in  working memory performance. However, no significant changes were identified in  the gait performance, heart rate or anxiety level of the patients. With regard to  the control stimulation, we did not identify significant changes in the variables  analyzed. The use of binaural-rhythm stimulation for PD, as designed in this  study, seems to be an effective, portable, inexpensive and noninvasive method to  modulate brain activity. This influence on brain activity did not induce changes  in anxiety or gait parameters; however, it resulted in a normalization of EEG  power (altered in PD), normalization of brain FC (also altered in PD) and working  memory improvement (a normalizing effect). In summary, we consider that sound,  particularly binaural-rhythmic sound, may be a co-assistant tool in the treatment  of PD, however more research is needed to consider the use of this type of  stimulation as an effective therapy.","2018-06","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","1750055","","5","28","","Int J Neural Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Singapore PMID: 29297265","","","","Female; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Heart Rate/physiology; Electroencephalography; *Anxiety/physiopathology/therapy; *Auditory Perception/physiology; *Gait/physiology; *Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Auditory cognitive neuroscience (ACN); binaural beats (BBs); Brain/*physiopathology; brainwave entrainment (BWE); Cognition/physiology; electroencephalography (EEG); frequency-following response (FFR); Neural Pathways/physiopathology; Parkinson Disease/*physiopathology/psychology/therapy; Parkinson’s disease (PD); Periodicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: In this open-label, multicenter,  randomized, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a novel VR  therapy solution for distraction in the context of bone marrow biopsy. METHODS:  Bliss is a VR software with 4 imaginary interactive environments in 3 dimensions  with binaural sound (head-mounted display). Efficacy regarding pain intensity was  evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS; score from 0 to 10) immediately after  the biopsy. Secondary end points were anxiety and tolerance. Modified  intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 126 patients with  previously documented untreated or suspected malignant hemopathy between  September 6, 2018, and May 18, 2020, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to  receive pain prevention with a mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen (MEOPA; n=63) or  VR (n=63) before and during the bone marrow biopsy. We excluded 8 patients from  the final analysis (3 in the MEOPA group and 5 in the VR group). All patients  received local anesthesia (lidocaine) before biopsy. Follow-up was limited to 1  month after the biopsy. Participants' median age was 65.5 (range 18-87) years,  and 54.2% (64/118) of patients were male. The average pain intensity was 3.5 (SD  2.6, 95% CI -1.6 to 8.6) for the MEOPA group and 3.0 (SD 2.4, 95% CI -1.7 to 7.7)  for the VR group, without any significant differences in age, sex, center, and  hemopathy (P=.26). Concerning anxiety, 67.5% (79/117; fear of pain questionnaire)  of the patients were afraid before the biopsy, and anxiety scores were moderate  to very high in 26.3% (30/114; revised Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  questionnaire) of the patients before the biopsy and 9.0% (10/114) after the  biopsy for all patients, without a significant difference between the 2 groups  (P=.83). Immersion in VR was well tolerated by the majority (54/57, 95%) of  patients in the VR group. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of pain did not  significantly differ between both arms. VR was well tolerated, and the  satisfaction of patients, nurses, and physicians was very high. VR could be an  alternative treatment in case of contraindication or intolerance to MEOPA.

Nature-based sound as a non-pharmacological and nursing  intervention effective in other contexts may be an efficient approach to  alleviating anxiety, agitation and adverse effects of sedative medication in  patients undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation. OBJECTIVES: This study  identified the effect of nature-based sound therapy on agitation and anxiety on  coronary artery bypass graft patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation.  METHODS: A randomised clinical trial design was used. 120 coronary artery bypass  graft patients aged 45-65 years undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation  were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Patients in the  intervention group listened to nature-based sounds through headphones; the  control group had headphones with no sound. Haemodynamic variables, anxiety  levels and agitation were assessed using the Faces Anxiety Scale and Richmond  Agitation Sedation Scale, respectively. Patients in both groups had vital signs  recorded after the first trigger, at 20 min intervals throughout the procedure,  immediately after the procedure, 20 min after extubation, and 30 min after  extubation. Data were collected over 5 months from December 2012 to April 2013.  RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly lower anxiety and agitation  levels than the control group. Regarding haemodynamic variables, a significant  time trend and interaction was reported between time and group (p<0.001). A  significant difference was also found between the anxiety (p<0.002) and agitation  (p<0.001) scores in two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nature-based sound can provide an  effective method of decreasing potential adverse haemodynamic responses arising  from anxiety and agitation in weaning from mechanical ventilation in coronary  artery bypass graft patients. Nurses can incorporate this intervention as a  non-pharmacological intervention into the daily care of patients undergoing  weaning from mechanical ventilation in order to reduce their anxiety and  agitation.","2014-04","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","526-538","","4","51","","Int J Nurs Stud","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after  loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a  temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself.  As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced  hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently  become the subject of research. METHODS: This study proposes a randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a  prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg)  prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is  the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome  measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant  treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure  tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product  otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise  testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By  use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to  placebo intake will be assessed. DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults  often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of  preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent  noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to  hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be  sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive  otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise  exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of  antioxidants during leisure noise activities.

The  response styles of attentional avoidance and attentional focusing were  manipulated in an analogue voice-hearing task. Predictions were that both would  increase detection of words in response to an ambiguous audio-recording but that  attentional avoidance would lead to a greater increase than focusing. We also  predicted that there would be a greater increase in anxiety and distress in the  avoidance group. Predictions were tested in a sample of 44 participants with a  diagnosis of schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned to either  attentional avoidance or focusing while listening to an ambiguous auditory task.  Number of words identified and anxiety and distress were recorded. As predicted,  there was an increase in the number of words identified in both groups; however,  this increase was greater in the avoidance group. The prediction that there would  also be an increase in distress that would be greater in the avoidance group was  not supported.

However, it remains unclear whether this effect is equally  efficacious in all individuals or whether it depends on interindividual  differences. Given that individuals differ in how they are impaired by somatic  complaints, we investigated whether somatic complaints moderate the  stress-reducing effect of listening to water sounds. METHODS: Sixty healthy women  (Mage = 25 years) were randomly allocated to 3 different conditions (listening to  water sounds, a relaxing piece of music, or no auditory stimulus: n = 20 per  condition) for 10 minutes before they were exposed to a standardized psychosocial  stress task. Salivary cortisol was assessed before, during, and after the stress  task. For binary logistic regression analyses, participants were divided into 2  groups: 1 group with a high salivary cortisol release and 1 group with low  cortisol release. The Freiburg Complaints Inventory was used to assess occurrence  of somatic complaints. RESULTS: A significant moderating effect of somatic  complaints on cortisol secretion was found in the group listening to water sounds  (χ(1) = 5.87, P < .015) but not in the other 2 groups, explaining 35.7% of the  variance and correctly classifying 78.9% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The  stress-reducing effect of listening to water sounds appears to depend on the  occurrence of somatic complaints. This effect was not found in the music or  silence condition. Individuals with somatic complaints may benefit from other,  potentially more powerful forms of stress-reducing interventions, that is,  combinations of visual and auditory stimuli.

For the primary outcome, fewer patients developed delirium in Group A than in  Group B and Group C (22.5 % vs. 26.8 % vs. 49.3 %, P = 0.001). For secondary  outcomes, Group A had lower delirium severity scores than the other groups did  (3.1 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 0.3 vs. 5.1 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). Patients in Group A had  shorter delirium durations (2.0 vs. 3.0 vs.4.0 days, P < 0.001) and longer  delirium-free days (3.0 vs. 2.0 vs. 1.0 days, P < 0.001) than those in Group B  and Group C. The time to first delirium was 3.0, 2.0, and 2.0 days, respectively  (P < 0.001). The SAS scores of the families in the three groups were 47.1 ± 5.7,  48.9 ± 5.5, and 56.5 ± 7.5 (P < 0.001) and the SDS scores were 38.2 ± 5.8,  38.3 ± 5.7, and 42.7 ± 7.2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that  structured family auditory stimulation could reduce delirium incidence, decrease  its severity, shorten the duration of delirium, increase delirium-free days, and  prolong the time to first delirium among ICU patients with unplanned admission.  Additionally, it could alleviate families' anxiety and depression levels.  IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Structured family auditory stimulation  prevents ICU delirium by maintaining the patients' cognitive function and  promoting early recovery, showing significant clinical potential in ICU delirium.","2025-08","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","103944","","","89","","Intensive Crit Care Nurs","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Its mechanism remains unclear, and no approved drugs are  available. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an exciting new method to treat  tinnitus, but direct electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus has  disadvantages. This randomized controlled clinical trial aims to overcome these  limitations by stimulating the auricular branch of vagus nerve (ABVN) on the  outer ear. Since the ABVN is the only peripheral branch of the vagus nerve  distributed on the ear's surface, it should be possible to achieve analogous  efficacy to VNS by activating the central vagal pathways. However, researches  have indicated that the curative effect lies in a combination of auditory and  vagal nerve stimulation. Moreover, from traditional Chinese theory, auricular  acupoints used to treat tinnitus are mainly in the regions supplied by the ABVN.  Whether stimulation at the auricular acupoints is due to unintentional  stimulation of vagal afferent fibers also needs evidence. METHODS/DESIGN: A total  of 120 subjects with subjective tinnitus are randomized equally into four groups:  (1) electrical stimulation at auricular acupoints (CO10, CO11, CO12, and TF4)  innervated by the ABVN; (2) electrical stimulation at auricular acupoints (CO10,  CO11, CO12, and TF4) innervated by ABVN pairing tones; (3) electrical stimulation  at auricular acupoints innervated by non-ABVN pairing tones; (4) electrical  acupuncture. Patients will be treated for 30 minutes every other day for 8 weeks.  The primary outcome measure is the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. The secondary  outcome measure combines a visual analogue scale to measure tinnitus disturbance  and loudness with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Assessment is  planned at baseline (before treatment) and in the 4th and 8th week, with further  follow-up visits after termination of the treatment at the 12th week. Any adverse  events will be promptly documented. DISCUSSION: Completion of this trial will  help to confirm whether ABVN or the combination of ABVN and sound stimulus plays  a more important role in treating tinnitus. Moreover, the result of this clinical  trial will enhance our understanding of specific auricular acupoints.

However, there is little understanding of how people with different mental health  histories and symptoms respond differently to music. A factorial experiment was  conducted to investigate the influence of depression, anxiety, apathy, and  cognitive decline on affective response to music. Ninety-nine people with  dementia listened to three music playlists based on personal preferences.  Activation of facial action units was measured, and behavioural responses  continuously observed. Results demonstrated that people with high levels of  depression and with symptoms of Alzheimer's type dementia demonstrated increased  levels of sadness when listening to music. People with low depression but high  levels of apathy demonstrated the highest behavioral evidence of pleasure during  music listening, although behavioral evidence declined with severity of cognitive  impairment. It is concluded that as well as accounting for personal preferences,  music interventions for people with dementia need to take mental health history  and symptoms into account.","2018","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","933-941","","3","64","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29966193","","","","music; depression; Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Heart Rate/physiology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Analysis of Variance; Galvanic Skin Response/physiology; Music Therapy/*methods; Acoustic Stimulation; *Individuality; Apathy; Cognition Disorders/etiology; Dementia; Dementia/complications/*psychology/*therapy; Facial Expression; individual differences; Mood Disorders/etiology; playlists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we further addressed the efficacy and safety  of CSWT in a single-arm multicenter study approved as a highly advanced medical  treatment by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Fifty patients  with refractory AP [mean age 70.9 ± 12.6 (SD) years, M/F 38/12] without the  indications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass  grafting (CABG) were enrolled in 4 institutes in Japan. Ischemic myocardial  regions in the left ventricle (LV) were identified by drug-induced stress  myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Shock waves (200 shots/spot at 0.09 mJ/mm(2))  were applied to 40-60 spots in the ischemic myocardium 3 times in the first week.  The patients were followed up for 3 months thereafter. Forty-one patients  underwent CSWT and completed the follow-up at 3 months. CSWT markedly improved  weekly nitroglycerin use [from 3.5 (IQR 2 to 6) to 0 (IQR 0 to 1)] and the  symptoms [Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional class score, from 2 (IQR 2  to 3) to 1 (IQR 1 to 2)] (both P < 0.001). CSWT also significantly improved 6-min  walking distance (from 384 ± 91 to 435 ± 122 m, P < 0.05). There were no  significant changes in LV ejection fraction evaluated by echocardiography and LV  stroke volume evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (from 56.3 ± 14.7  to 58.8 ± 12.8%, P = 0.10, and from 52.3 ± 17.4 to 55.6 ± 15.7 mL, P = 0.15,  respectively). Percent myocardium ischemia assessed by drug-induced stress MPI  tended to be improved only in the treated segments (from 16.0 ± 11.1 to  12.1 ± 16.2%, P = 0.06), although no change was noted in the whole LV. No  procedural complications or adverse effects related to the CSWT were noted. These  results of the multicenter trial further indicate that CSWT is a useful and safe  non-invasive strategy for patients with refractory AP with no options of PCI or  CABG.","2019-01","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","104-113","","1","34","","Heart Vessels","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 29942978","","","","Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Treatment Outcome; High-Energy Shock Waves/*therapeutic use; Angina Pectoris/diagnosis/*therapy; Echocardiography; Angiogenesis; Cardiac shock wave therapy; Electrocardiography; Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy/*methods; Japan; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Myocardial ischemia; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Refractory angina pectoris","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to evaluate the effect of music played  through noise-canceling headphones on male bladder cancer patients during  follow-up cystoscopy. METHODS: A total of 160 male bladder cancer patients  undergoing follow-up flexible cystoscopy were randomly divided into the  noise-canceling headphones without music group and the noise-canceling headphones  with music group (groups 1 and 2, respectively; n = 80 per group). The patients'  clinical characteristics were examined, and objective and subjective measurements  were compared before and after cystoscopy. The primary outcomes that were  evaluated included the visual analog scale (VAS, 0-10) and the state-trait  anxiety inventory (STAI, 20-80). Other outcomes, including vital signs and scores  for assessing satisfaction and the willingness to repeat the procedure, were also  examined. RESULTS: The characteristics of the patients in groups 1 and 2, and  their pre-cystoscopy status, did not differ significantly. Although  post-cystoscopy vital signs for the objective parameters and VAS pain scores were  similar between the groups, subjective parameters were not. When compared with  group 1, post-cystoscopy STAI-state scores were significantly lower in group 2,  whereas patients' satisfaction scores and the willingness to repeat the procedure  were significantly higher in group 2 (p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively).  Additionally, in group 2, STAI-state scores changed significantly after the  procedure when compared with before the procedure (p = 0.002).

Seventy-five  participants completed the study. They were assigned to white noise, lullaby, and  control groups in equal numbers. Each group included 25 women. The questionnaires  included descriptive characteristics of mothers, the LATCH Breastfeeding  Assessment Tool, the Newborn Stress Scale, and the Visual Analog Scale. During  the breastfeeding process, the newborn and mother listened to white noise and  lullaby for approximately 15 min. The newborn stress and mothers' level of  comfort were assessed before and after the interventions. The breastfeeding  success of the mother assessed with the LATCH was completed within the first  15 min of breastfeeding. RESULTS: The mean scores obtained from the Newborn  Stress Scale by the mothers in the lullaby group and white noise group decreased  significantly after the intervention. A significant difference was also observed  in the control group. There were also significant differences between the changes  in the mothers' comfort level of all groups. There were significant differences  between the changes in the LATCH scores of the groups.

The prefrontal cortex, a critical region of the brain responsible for  higher cognitive functions and emotional regulation, may influence an  individual's mental and physical health through its responses to external  stimuli. Although previous research has investigated the calming effects of white  noise, systematic studies on its specific impact on prefrontal cortex activity  are still lacking. This study aims to explore the calming effects of white noise  on the prefrontal cortex to elucidate its associated physiological mechanisms.  METHODS: In total, 103 healthy adult college students were recruited and randomly  divided into four groups (fire, n = 24; wind, n = 27; rain, n = 27; and snow,  n = 25), with each group exposed to the corresponding white noise for 3 min.  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to evaluate excitability  changes in the brain and changes in life signs and facial expressions were also  measured. RESULTS: The data of fNIRS were analyzed by paired sample t-test; in  the wind group and the snow group, we found that the white noise can be  effectively decreased the cortical excitability of related brain areas. The areas  of reduced excitability were concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and pars  triangularis of Broca's frontopolar area, while the concentration of  oxyhemoglobin in these two area decreased from -0.159 to -0.107 µmol/L and from  -0.139 to -0.096 µmol/L, respectively, both areas involved in relaxing and  sedative modulation. CONCLUSION: White noise can reduce the excitability of the  prefrontal cortex and play a sedative effect. It may strengthen our understanding  of how white noise is involved in neural modulation.","2025-02-01","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","26-32","","124","27","","Noise Health","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2025 Noise & Health.","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 40029675  PMCID: PMC11991127","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult; *Noise; Facial Expression; *Prefrontal Cortex/physiology/diagnostic imaging; Oxyhemoglobins/analysis; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long COVID symptoms overlap with symptoms that the Biosound  Therapy System (BTS) has been shown to improve. The BTS is a multimodal treatment  that includes biofeedback, vibroacoustic therapy synchronized with music that  plays binaural beats, and video content. This study aimed to determine  feasibility for a future full-scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and explore  the impact of the BTS on long COVID symptoms. METHODS: This pre-post pilot study  was conducted in an outpatient mental health clinic. Adults aged 20-65 years old  with persistent COVID-19 symptoms were screened and randomly assigned to the  intervention or control group. The intervention group was given 8 Biosound  Therapy sessions during a period of 4 weeks. All participants were assessed at  baseline and at post-intervention using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9),  Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS)  tasks, and the COVID-19 Persistent Symptom Questionnaire. The feasibility  outcomes were recruitment rates, retention rates, and open-ended questions about  participants' experiences. RESULTS: 15 participants enrolled in the study and 13  completed the study (9 intervention, 4 control). Trial recruitment ended  prematurely due to the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Participants  responded to open-ended questions with only positive remarks and made no comments  on the study not being feasible. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that  compared to baseline, participants in the intervention group had significant  improvement in their GAD-7 score, PHQ9 score, 2 Cambridge Brain Science tasks  (""Odd"" and ""Double Trouble""), fatigue, and difficulties in concentrating or  remembering (p < 0.05; 95 % CI). CONCLUSION: The intervention group showed  promising improvement without reported side effects. A full-scale RCT is feasible  as long as the recruitment setting is changed to a location that allows access to  more patients with long COVID.

However, validation of the usefulness of psychological strategies is  limited in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effects of psychological  strategies on both physiologic (salivary cortisol) and subjective assessments of  stress. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Laboratory.  PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 97 college-aged students (age = 20.65  ± 4.38 years), most with little to no experience with psychological strategies.  INTERVENTION(S): A 15-minute script via an iPod led the participant through  visual imagery (cognitive relaxation) or deep breathing exercises (somatic  relaxation) cues. The control group listened to 15 minutes of ambient nature  sounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Two samples (pretest, posttest) of salivary  cortisol were analyzed using an enzyme immunoassay kit; the average was used for  statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics and correlations were conducted to  examine group differences in time of day, salivary cortisol, sex, Stress-O-Meter  values, and Perceived Stress Scale scores. RESULTS: Salivary cortisol levels were  lower in the treatment group than the control group (F2,97 = 15.62, P < .001).  Females had higher scores on both the pretest Stress-O-Meter (5.15 ± 1.796) and  the Perceived Stress Scale (18.31 ± 5.833) than males (4.25 ± 1.741 and 15.272 ±  5.390, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive and somatic relaxation  strategies reduced cortisol levels. Participants who received verbal guidance  achieved a larger cortisol reduction. However, the change in cortisol level was  uncorrelated with the change in report of acute stress; females reported higher  levels of stress. Clinical implications include attention to sex when assessing  stress and providing coping skills during the rehabilitation process.","2014-06","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","331-337","","3","49","","J Athl Train","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24490842  PMCID: PMC4080595","","","","relaxation; Psychophysiology; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Adolescent; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Reference Values; Attention; Athletic Performance/*physiology/*psychology; Breathing Exercises/*psychology; cognitive relaxation; cortisol; Cues; Holistic Health; Hydrocortisone/*analysis; Imagery, Psychotherapy; Relaxation Therapy/*psychology; Saliva/chemistry; Sex Characteristics; somatic relaxation; Stress, Psychological/physiopathology/*psychology/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this naturally-occurring field experiment was  to assess the influence of a non-talking rule on the actual sound level and  perception of patients in an outpatient infusion center. In a quasi-randomized  trial two conditions were compared in real life. In the control condition,  patients (n = 137) were allowed to talk to fellow patients and visitors during  the treatment. In the intervention condition patients (n = 126) were requested  not to talk to fellow patients and visitors during their treatment. This study  measured the actual sound levels in dB(A) as well as patients' preferences  regarding sound and their perceptions of the physical environment, anxiety, and  quality of health care. A linear-mixed-model showed a statistically significant,  but rather small reduction of the non-talking rule on the actual sound level with  an average of 1.1 dB(A). Half of the patients preferred a talking condition  (57%), around one-third of the patients had no preference (36%), and 7% of the  patients preferred a non-talking condition. Our results suggest that patients who  preferred non-talking, perceived the environment more negatively compared to the  majority of patients and perceived higher levels of anxiety. Results showed no  significant effect of the experimental conditions on patient perceptions. In  conclusion, a non-talking rule of conduct only minimally reduced the actual sound  level and did not influence the perception of patients.","2019","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","e0212804","","2","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30817782  PMCID: PMC6395026","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; *Speech Acoustics; *Patient Preference; Noise/legislation & jurisprudence/*prevention & control; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/*legislation & jurisprudence; Outpatients/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of the present study was to investigate the  effects of pleasant and unpleasant audiovisual stimuli on perceptual and  psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercises performed on an  electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Twenty young adults were administered  three experimental conditions in a randomised and counterbalanced order:  unpleasant stimulus (US; e.g. images depicting laboured breathing); pleasant  stimulus (PS; e.g. images depicting pleasant emotions); and neutral stimulus (NS;  e.g. neutral facial expressions). The exercise had 10 min of duration (2 min of  warm-up + 6 min of exercise + 2 min of warm-down). During all conditions, the  rate of perceived exertion and heart rate variability were monitored to further  understanding of the moderating influence of audiovisual stimuli on perceptual  and psychophysiological responses, respectively. The results of the present study  indicate that PS ameliorated fatigue-related symptoms and reduced the  physiological stress imposed by the exercise bout. Conversely, US increased the  global activity of the autonomic nervous system and increased exertional  responses to a greater degree when compared to PS. Accordingly, audiovisual  stimuli appear to induce a psychophysiological response in which individuals  visualise themselves within the story presented in the video. In such instances,  individuals appear to copy the behaviour observed in the videos as if the  situation was real. This mirroring mechanism has the potential to  up-/down-regulate the cardiac work as if in fact the exercise intensities were  different in each condition.","2018-05","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","560-568","","4","18","","Eur J Sport Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 29529938","","","","Psychophysiology; Adult; Humans; Young Adult; Environment; *Emotions; Heart Rate; *Acoustic Stimulation; *Photic Stimulation; Applied psychology; Autonomic Nervous System/physiology; Exercise/*psychology; Fatigue/psychology; heart; physical exercise; Physical Exertion; psychophysiology; sensory aids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulation-based experiments would offer  controllable and safe venues for investigating this noise problem. However,  realistic simulation of the clinical auditory environment is rare in current  simulators. Therefore, we retrofitted our operating room simulator to be able to  produce immersive auditory simulations with the use of typical sound sources  encountered during surgeries. Then, we tested the hypothesis that anesthesia  residents would perceive greater task load and fatigue while being given  simulated lunch breaks in noisy environments rather than in quiet ones. As a  secondary objective, we proposed and tested the plausibility of a novel  psychometric instrument for the assessment of stress. METHODS: In this  simulation-based, randomized, repeated-measures, crossover study, 2 validated  psychometric survey instruments, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), composed of  6 items, and the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (SOFI), composed of 5  items, were used to assess perceived task load and fatigue, respectively, in  first-year anesthesia residents. Residents completed the psychometric instruments  after being given lunch breaks in quiet and noisy intraoperative environments  (soundscapes). The effects of soundscape grouping on the psychometric instruments  and their comprising items were analyzed with a split-plot analysis. A model for  a new psychometric instrument for measuring stress that combines the NASA-TLX and  SOFI instruments was proposed, and a factor analysis was performed on the  collected data to determine the model's plausibility. RESULTS: Twenty residents  participated in this study. Multivariate analysis of variance showed an effect of  soundscape grouping on the combined NASA-TLX and SOFI instrument items (P =  0.003) and the comparisons of univariate item reached significance for the NASA  Temporal Demand item (P = 0.0004) and the SOFI Lack of Energy item (P = 0.001).  Factor analysis extracted 4 factors, which were assigned the following construct  names for model development: Psychological Task Load, Psychological Fatigue,  Acute Physical Load, and Performance-Chronic Physical Load. Six of the 7 fit  tests used in the partial confirmatory factor analysis were positive when we  fitted the data to the proposed model, suggesting that further validation is  warranted. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that noise during surgery  can increase feelings of stress, as measured by perceived task load and fatigue  levels, in anesthesiologists and adds to the growing literature pointing to an  overall adverse impact of clinical noise on caregivers and patient safety. The  psychometric model proposed in this study for assessing perceived stress is  plausible based on factor analysis and will be useful for characterizing the  impact of the clinical environment on subject stress levels in future  investigations.","2016-02","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","512-525","","2","122","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26797555","","","","Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Environment; Stress, Psychological/psychology; Risk Assessment; Psychometrics; Noise/*adverse effects; Intraoperative Period; Anesthesia; Anesthesiology/*statistics & numerical data; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Fatigue/epidemiology/*etiology; Internship and Residency/*statistics & numerical data; Medical Errors/statistics & numerical data; Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data; Operating Rooms/organization & administration; Workload/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the  psychophysiological benefits of nature-based soundscapes, drawing on the  biophilia hypothesis. Using a randomized, acute cross-over design, 53 healthy  participants experienced either a nature-based or a reference soundscape for  10 min, with a 2-min washout period. The nature-based soundscape integrated  nature sounds with elements of music to create an immersive nature experience.

However,  behavioral implications of this finding remain unknown. In a placebo-controlled,  blinded, cross-over design the rapid effects of IV hydrocortisone (5mg) on  cross-modal integration of simultaneous, unilateral visual and acoustic signals  in a challenging startle and reaction time (RT) paradigm were studied. On two  separate days 1 week apart, 24 male volunteers responded by button push to either  up- or down pointing triangles presented in random sequence in the periphery of  one of the visual hemi-fields. Visual targets were accompanied by unilateral  acoustic startle noise bursts, presented at the same or opposite side. Saccadic  latency, manual RT, and startle eye blink responses were recorded. Faster manual  reactions and increased startle eye blink responses were observed 11-20 min after  hydrocortisone administration when visual targets and unilateral acoustic startle  noises were presented in the same sensory hemi-field, but not when presented in  opposite sensory hemi-fields. Our results suggest that a nongenomic,  cortisol-sensitive mechanism enhances psychomotor and startle reactions when  stimuli occur in the same sensory hemi-field. Such basic cognitive effects of  cortisol may serve rapid adaptation and protection against danger stimuli in  stressful contexts.","2014-11","2025-11-07 06:46:43","2025-11-07 06:46:43","","1828-1835","","11","24","","Eur Neuropsychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Hereby  we report the results of an imaging sub-study that evaluated the capacity of CSWT  to ameliorate myocardial ischemia induced during dobutamine stress  echocardiography (DSE) and cardiac single photon emission computed tomography  (SPECT). METHODS: Prospective, randomized, triple-blind, sham  procedure-controlled study enrolled 72 adult subjects who complied with defined  inclusion criteria. The subjects were assigned to the OMT + CSWT and the  OMT + sham procedure study groups with 1:1 ratio. Application of the CSWT covered  all segments of the left ventricle. Imaging ischemia tests were performed in 59  study patients: DSE and SPECT before the CSWT treatment and after 6 months, with  DSE carried out additionally at 3 months after randomization. Co-primary  endpoints of the study were: change in wall motion score index (WMSI),  representing the stress-induced impairment of regional myocardial function, and  change in summed difference score (SDS), representing the amount of perfusion  defect. RESULTS: OMT + CSWT and OMT + sham procedure study groups included 30 and  29 patients, respectively. Regional myocardial contractility during DSE  significantly improved at 3 months follow-up in OMT + CSWT group compared to  baseline as shown by WMSI at stress (1.4 ± 0.4 vs 1.6 ± 0.4, p = 0.001), but not  in OMT + sham procedure group (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 1.6 ± 0.4, p = 0.136).

While the best way to rid  society of drug addiction is to prevent it from occurring in the first place,  this is highly unlikely in the near future given the many ways that individuals  can be first exposed to some potentially addicting substance. When an addiction  is established, the first treatment for it is detoxification, but the insidious  nature of addiction is its propensity to relapse. Too often, detoxified addicts  resume drug use despite knowing that they are exposing themselves to serious,  sometimes fatal, consequences. In an attempt to ward off relapse following  detoxification, drug treatment centers, clinics, rehabilitation facilities,  half-way houses, etc., offer different types of programs to help addicts stay  clean. Examples of such treatments are 12-step programs, cognitive behavioral  therapy (CBT), faith-based programs, and so forth. In addition, narcotics like  methadone and suboxone, are sometimes prescribed to control the cravings that  drive relapse, but this approach simply substitutes one drug for another. We now  hypothesize that the auditory system can be used as a sensory conduit to modify  the hijacked brain reward system of recently-detoxified addicts. As a rationale  for this hypothesis, we present evidence from basic science studies showing the  effect of music (the sensory input) on the brain, and from clinical trials  employing music in a variety of neurological conditions. We then summarize an  IRB-approved randomized control trial we performed to determine if our sound  intervention could reduce the probability of relapse in recently-detoxified  subjects. We end with suggestions for further study.","2018-09","2025-11-07 06:46:44","2025-11-07 06:46:44","","84-91","","","118","","Med Hypotheses","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Karolinska sleepiness scale was used to  evaluate current subjective sleepiness, and the relative pupillary unrest index  to assess objective sleepiness. In this randomized cross-over study, the  intervention consisted of a 20-minute stay in a hammock while the singing bowl,  positioned beneath, was struck seven times. The controlled comparator was a  20-minute stay in the same hammock above the singing bowl, but without being  struck. After these two interventions subjective and objective sleepiness were  re-evaluated. RESULTS: The mean relative pupillary unrest index values after  relaxation in the struck and silent singing bowl groups were 0.74 and  respectively 0.71 (p = 0.460). The median Karolinska sleepiness scale value after  relaxation with the struck singing bowl was 3 compared with 4 (p = 0.041) for the  silent singing bowl. DISCUSSION: This study evaluated the influence of a struck  singing bowl on sleepiness during daytime. Subjective sleepiness was  significantly lower after relaxation above a struck singing bowl. After gender  stratification, the difference was still significant in women. Objective  sleepiness was not different in both groups. Finally, we can only speculate if  women may be more susceptible to subjective improvements in case of sleepiness  and show another perception of relaxation in a struck singing bowl compared to  men.","2020","2025-11-07 06:46:44","2025-11-07 06:46:44","","e0233982","","6","15","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32479559  PMCID: PMC7263600","","","","Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Prospective Studies; Healthy Volunteers; Polysomnography; *Sleepiness; Acoustic Stimulation/*instrumentation/methods; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/diagnosis/physiopathology/*rehabilitation; Pupil/physiology; Relaxation/*physiology; Sleep Stages/physiology; Wakefulness/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, applications of shinrin-yoku in virtual reality (VR) have been investigated as means of providing similar mental health benefits to people that do not have direct access to nature. These applications have shown similar health benefits, although not to the extent of real nature. The factors that make VR nature immersion effective are little researched to date. This paper investigates the Biophilia Hypothesis in the context of a VR-based nature immersion experience. Twenty-six participants were immersed in a computer-generated virtual natural environment that was either high in biomass (forest) or devoid of biomass (canyon), after experiencing an arithmetic stressor task. We compared multiple restorative outcomes between the high and low biomass groups, as well as preference ratings for real and virtual high and low biomass scenes among all participants.

We use the experimental method, the restorative natural scene provided by VR head display device (HMD) was used to study different pressure groups through two variables 2 (pressure: high and low)×2 (immersion: high, low) inter group design, based on the analysis of experimental data, this paper discusses the differences between subjective indexes (stress awareness, positive emotion, negative emotion, perceptual recovery) and objective indexes (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, attention) after watching the natural environment intervention provided by VR HMD. The results showed that among the seven pairs of dependent variables related to stress, there were significant differences in five pairs (pressure value, negative emotion, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and attention time), and the value of perceptual recovery scale (PRS=11.746±8.892) was positive. For the difference of 8 pressure indicators, 2 (pressure: high, low) ×2 (immersion: high, low) two-way ANOVA showed that the effect of stress factor was significant or marginal significant on the three indexes (F pressure difference (1,66) = 15.946, P &lt; 0.001; F negative emotion difference (1, 66) =0.338, P = 0.080; FPRS (1,66) = 5.552, P = 0.022), and other indexes were not significant. The post test found that the average value of the three groups of data was that the high-pressure group was greater than the low-pressure group, and the pressure difference in the high-pressure group (M= 7.3939, SD =4.993) was higher than that in the low-pressure group (M=2.2647, SD=5.362); The negative emotion difference in the high-pressure group (M=0.5000, SD=3.250) was higher than that in the low-pressure group (M=2.0303, SD=4.297);The PRS value of high-pressure group (M=14.2727, SD=8.232) was higher than that of low-pressure group (M=9.2941, SD=8.936). Therefore, the conclusion of this experiment is that the restorative natural scene provided by VR HMD has the effect of relaxation and decompression. Stress factors have a significant impact on the decompression effect. The subjective decompression effect of high-pressure group is more obvious than that of low-pressure group, and the objective index is not significant. VR immersion has no significant effect on the relief of stress symptoms. The experimental results suggest that the VR scene design with the goal of relaxation and decompression can more consider the use of restorative natural scenes to improve the user experience. The design of virtual reality scene does not need to blindly pursue immersion.","2022","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","399–406","","","","","","","ICBDE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Shanghai, China","","","","Virtual reality; Decompression; Immersion; Restorative environment; VR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to perform effectively under stress is a critical skill for these professionals, as their decisions can have significant consequences. One of the most effective methods for inducing stress in training scenarios is through the use of virtual environments. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for the creation of highly realistic and immersive training environments. These technologies can simulate a wide range of scenarios, from battlefield conditions for military personnel to emergency response situations for first responders and complex surgical procedures for healthcare professionals. This type of training aims to prepare individuals to respond effectively in real-life scenarios, enhancing resilience and decision-making abilities under stress. Measuring stress levels during these trainings is essential to assess program effectiveness and adjust methodologies as needed. By monitoring physiological and psychological stress indicators, such as heart rate variability, cortisol levels, and self-reported stress scales, trainers can determine if the scenarios are inducing the desired level of stress. This measurement ensures that participants are genuinely engaged in the training, allowing for real-time adjustments to the intensity and nature of the scenarios to maximize the training benefits. Additionally, it helps in verifying that the participant is fully immersed and responding realistically to the simulated high-pressure environment, ensuring the training’s relevance and effectiveness. Therefore, through a Systematic Literature Review, this study investigated the best biomarkers and their combinations and protocols used, aiming to determine the most effective way to measure stress induction in training to improve their efficiency.","2024","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:53:09","","177–184","","","","","","","SVR '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Manaus, Brazil","","","","Virtual Reality; Psychophysiology; Serious Games; Stress; Virtual Environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I will show the impact that stimulating more senses can have on user quality of experience, sense of presence and immersion, and engagement levels.Moreover, with multisensory experiences, monitoring human influential factors is crucial, as the perception of sensory stimuli can be very subjective (e.g., while a smell can be pleasant for some, it can be unpleasant for others). To this end, I will also describe our work on instrumenting virtual reality headsets with biosensors to allow not only for automated (remote) monitoring of human behaviour and tracking of human influential factors, but to also develop new markers of user experience, such as a multimodal time perception metric or a cybersickness metric.Lastly, I will describe some new applications of multisensory experiences that we are developing for healthcare and well-being. I will start with the use of immersive multisensory nature walks for mental health and describe two ongoing projects, one with patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and another with nurses suffering from burnout.

This trend has opened up new possibilities for museums to create interactive and immersive experiences using virtual reality (VR). In collaboration with the Florida Natural History Museum, we have developed an interactive VR game that utilizes the extensive 3D digital collection of the Florida Museum. The goal is to enhance the traditional museum experience by immersing visitors in dynamic VR environments that showcase 3D museum collections within context. Specifically, our VR game highlights 3D scans of endangered species of underwater creatures in the ocean. Children can swim alongside these sea creatures while an AI conversational agent provides scientific insights. Our VR game was showcased to the public at the Florida Natural History Museum during a public outreach event, attracting visits from three K-12 school trips. We conducted field observations to evaluate children’s interactions with the VR game and conducted semi-structured interviews with children’s guardians as well as museum staff. The findings from our observations emphasized the importance of shared experiences among visitors, which could be facilitated by projecting the VR gameplay on a large screen to mitigate the isolated nature of the HMD VR experience limitations. Additionally, museum staff emphasized the significance of considering visitor traffic when designing VR experiences in museum settings. The findings also highlighted a preference for seated experiences over standing ones due to safety concerns related to children colliding with others and museum artifacts. This paper provides an overview of our design process and the challenges of implementing HMD VR in museum settings, offering valuable insights for future endeavors aimed at designing public VR educational experiences targeting children.","2024","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","670–675","","","","","","","IDC '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Delft, Netherlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing works on PSA rely on self-reports and aggregate multimodal measures which do not capture the temporal variation in PSA. This paper examines temporal trajectories of acoustic and physiological measures throughout the public speaking encounter with real and virtual audiences, and aims to model those in both knowledge- and data-driven ways. Knowledge-driven models leverage theoretically-grounded patterns through fitting interpretable parametric functions to the corresponding signals. Data-driven models consider the functional nature of multimodal signals via functional principal component analysis. Results indicate that the parameters of the proposed models can successfully estimate individuals’ trait anxiety in both real-life and virtual reality settings, and suggest that models trained on data obtained in virtual public speaking stimuli are able to estimate levels of PSA in real-life.","2021","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","712–716","","","","","","","ICMI '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montréal, QC, Canada","","","","functional principal component analysis; physiological signals; Public speaking anxiety; speech; time trajectory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we introduce SWISH, an ungrounded mixed-reality interface, capable of affording the users a realistic haptic sensation of fluid behaviors in vessels. The chief mechanism behind SWISH is in the use of virtual reality tracking and motor actuation to actively relocate the center of gravity of a handheld vessel, emulating the moving center of gravity of a handheld vessel that contains fluid. In addition to solving challenges related to reliable and efficient motor actuation, our SWISH designs place an emphasis on reproducibility, scalability, and availability to the maker culture. Our virtual-to-physical coupling uses Nvidia Flex's Unity integration for virtual fluid dynamics with a 3D printed augmented vessel containing a motorized mechanical actuation system. To evaluate the effectiveness and perceptual efficacy of SWISH, we conduct a user study with 24 participants, 7 vessel actions, and 2 virtual fluid viscosities in a virtual reality environment. In all cases, the users on average reported that the SWISH bucket generates accurate tactile sensations for the fluid behavior.

Each individual microstory, or vignette, is designed to encourage a kind of ""narrative smearing""—where traditional story techniques are truncated and mutated into smears (kinetic actions and mechanics, collagelike layered building blocks, visual distortions, dual-tiered text annotations) that require a reader/interactor to make active choices in order to navigate each microstory space (storybox). The microstories presented are part of the ongoing V[R]ignettes Series. When exploring each microstory, a reader will experience poetically dense language (such as letters bracketed in words—requiring rereading—that are designed to expand and enhance meaning potentials) and various visual, textual and technological elements that require direct audience input (such as: Do you choose to view each microstory in a 3D or VR space—through a virtual reality headset or a mobile phone or computer monitor? Do you set each microstory to autopilot or navigate the experience through manual annotation click-throughs and spatial manipulations? Do you choose to use the model inspector and view the microstories without any post-processing effects, or in wireframe? Do you choose to enable audio? Do you read only the title fields or entire paragraphs?). Such smears are also designed to be combined by the reader to create a story-piecing system that's circular in nature, where a reader/interactor is encouraged to experience each microstory multiple times, in multiple ways. For instance, when experiencing ""In the Skin of the Gloam,"" if a reader chooses to read only the title line of each annotation, they'll experience a minimal poetic (title) text version. If they instead read the rest of the annotation accompanying each title line, the narrative is accented differently. If they choose to manipulate (scale, rotate, zoom) the 3D models in the space (and/or if they engage autoplay or, in the case of ""Wracking in the Upper Bubble,"" read the wall text only), a reader's experience will be markedly different from those choosing to experience each microstory in a VR space (where teleportation is an option and the spatial dimension is crucial). To load each microstory, readers press the white arrow in the middle of each V[R]ignettes storybox (and if viewing on a mobile device, they need to make sure to view each storybox in full screen mode). After clicking on the white arrow, to begin reading the text they click on the ""Select an annotation"" bar at the bottom of each storybox screen.

In the short term, stress often leads to problematic behaviors known as “acting out,” which, despite its harmful nature, is easily chosen and even perceived as a convenient stress-relief method. To address this, our study aimed to suppress harmful behavioral activation by inducing harmless alternatives. Specifically, we sought to create a VR-based destructive experience using pseudo-loud vocalization that does not require actual voice production, achieved through auditory stimuli and laryngeal vibratory stimuli. Experimental results showed that vibratory stimuli enhanced the loud vocal agency and may have amplified the positive emotional effects of vocalization itself. Conversely, the visual scenes elicited not only a sense of exhilaration but also feelings of surprise and fear, failing to deliver a generalized stress-relief effect.","2025","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","","","","","","","","CHI EA '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Virtual reality; Haptics; Sense of agency; Vocalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the beginning of the year 2000, most people used to share and search almost only text. Then, they started to be interested in sharing and searching images and, in the latter years, videos with different formats and resolutions.One of the emerging technologies of this decade is Virtual Reality (VR) through which people can share resources in a more exciting and enjoyable manner. If a decade ago people used to only read about how to do things, now they see it being done in videos. Expectations are that, in the not so distant future, they will be able to visualize and experience it through the power of VR. But, new technologies come with new challenges. Video streaming, especially for VR, generates a great amount of data. Techniques used until now need to evolve or lead the way for better ones. Centralized approaches for big data live streaming are no longer appropriate. Peer-to-Peer networks are more suitable due to their decentralized nature and auto-adaptive property.The aim of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the performances of the SPIDER Peer-to-Peer Overlay in the context of live video streaming for two Cloud use cases. The first scenario entitled CyberWater aims to create an e-platform for sustainable water resources with a high focus on pollution phenomena. The second scenario, called ClueFarm, is a Cloud service-based system for quality business development in the farming sector.The experimental results presented in this paper focus on the amount of bandwidth needed in booth test scenarios and emphasize the advantages of the SPIDER Peer-to-Peer Overlay.","2016","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","52–58","","","","","","","ARMS-CC'16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Chicago, IL, USA","","","","Auto-adaptive systems; Bio-inspired systems; Cloud systems; Cyber Physical Infrastructure; Live streaming; Peer-to-Peer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the gaming context, we pondered: What impact does playing a horror game alongside a confident virtual character, compared to an anxious one, have on players’ emotional states and experiences? We conducted a lab study with 69 participants and compared a VR horror game played with either a confident or anxious virtual character or alone. Horror games were chosen for their ability to evoke intense emotions, like fear. Our results show that participants could accurately recognize the emotional states portrayed by the virtual character.

Routers, including VRs, have been the target of several recent high-profile attacks, emphasizing the need for more security measures, including security monitoring. However, existing agent-based monitoring systems are incompatible with a VR's temporary nature, stripped-down operating system, and placement in the cloud. As a result, VRs are often not monitored, leading to undetected security incidents.This paper proposes a new security monitoring design that leverages virtualization instead of in-guest agents. Its hypervisor-based system, Arav, scrutinizes VRs by novel application of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) breakpoint injection. Arav monitored and addressed security-related events in two common VRs, pfSense and VyOS, and detected four attacks against two popular VR services, Quagga and OpenVPN. Arav's performance overhead is negligible, less than 0.63%, demonstrating VMI's utility in monitoring virtual machines unsuitable for traditional security monitoring.","2017","2025-11-07 06:52:27","2025-11-07 06:52:27","","","","","","","","","CISRC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA","","","","cloud security; virtual machine introspection; virtual routers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents the Visual Heights VR experience that integrates natural breathing as an input method to provide visual respiratory feedback. Incorporating spatial audio, haptic feedback and breath visualisation, the experience aims to be highly immersive. This experience was made to be used as part of a controlled pilot study to see the effect of respiratory feedback on the user’s anxiety levels. The user’s anxiety is assessed by their heart rate, brain electrical activity, skin conductance and respiratory rate. These biosignals are recorded within the experience; captured by external hardware. The pieces of hardware used were Galvanic Skin Response to measure skin conductance, photoplethysmogram to measure heart rate; Electroencephalogram to measure the electrical activity in the brain, and a prototype device that records airflow on an axis from -1 to 1 for respiratory rate. It was found that the aforementioned prototype was not sufficient for calculating the respiratory rate. Results of the controlled study showed that the Visual Heights VR experience delivered the expected positive correlation between skin conductance and perceived height (r=.491, p &lt; .05, N=1543) which suggests it is plausible to be used as a material for further research. As the integration of user’s physiological signals and breathing for visual feedback can contribute to therapeutic uses of VR, research with bigger sample sizes will be conducted to better investigate the relationship between visual respiratory feedback and anxiety using the Visual Heights VR experience.","2021","2025-11-07 06:52:40","2025-11-07 06:52:40","","1–6","","","","","","","IMX '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","VR; anxiety; biosensors; biosignals; EEG; exposure therapy; GSR; PPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the current mainstream machine learning approaches are largely supervised and must be trained by a large amount of labelled high-quality data. In contrast, due to small form factor and limited sensing capability, today's off-the-shelf mobile devices can only collect noisy and sporadic samples from users. Moreover, personal health data collected by on-device sensors cannot be uploaded or shared with other devices due to privacy concerns. These challenges have significantly hindered the performance and utility of mobile health systems in real-world settings. In this talk, I will first discuss new mobile systems that exploit human physiological models and innovative use of sensing modalities to achieve highly robust sensing performance without requiring extensive training. I will describe RunBuddy - the first smartphone-based system for monitoring continuous running rhythm and improving exercise efficiency. To mitigate significant environmental noise during running, RunBuddy integrates novel ambient sensing algorithms and a physiological model called Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC). Based on this result, we also develop BreathCoach, a smart and unobtrusive system using smartwatch and smartphone-based VR for in-home RSA-BT (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia biofeedback-based Breathing Training), which is a common cardiorespiratory intervention to diseases such as asthma and an effective exercise to reduce anxiety. BreathCoach continuously monitors key bio-signals such as breathing pattern and inter-beat interval, and then recommends breathing patterns in the form of an intuitive VR game to provide an immersive training experience. In the second part of this talk, I will discuss a new approach for home activity recognition via federated learning. People spend significant portion of time in home. Characterizing home activities including both individual and family activities is important for studies of health, sociology, and home economics. For instance, risk factors of dementia and childhood obesity are strongly associated with a family's daily activities, and activity logging is proved a very effective approach to improve the self-awareness and motivate people to modify their behaviors toward a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, to date, there has been no unobtrusive and convenient methods to log family activities. I will present several new sensing and federated learning algorithms that enable mobile devices to collaboratively improve the accuracy of home activity sensing without sharing any sensor data, preserving user privacy.","2020","2025-11-07 06:52:40","2025-11-07 06:52:40","","2","","","","","","","HealthDL'20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto, ON, Canada","","","","Machine Learning; Federated Learning; Mobile Health Systems; Physiological Model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To quantify these emotions, the measurement of certain biological indices is necessary. The existing technology currently being used to gather different biological information is faced with challenges, such as user load of mounting sensors that the user needs to wear, and a noisy output arising from the user’s body movements. In this paper, we present the development of a biological information measuring device that can be easily attached onto a head mounted display (HMD). As the proposed device allows for the HMD to be strongly attached to the face, it is believed to be robust to body movements, and consequently, the mounting load of the sensor also becomes negligible. To easily attach the sensing device to the existing HMD, a pulse wave sensor and a respiratory sensor were integrated on the nose. The pulse wave was measured from an optical pulse wave sensor, and the respiration from a thermopile. Experiments were conducted to verify that these measurements were sufficiently accurate for the estimation of the user’s tension and excitement. This research therefore highlights the possibility that emotions can be quantified using only an HMD during a VR experience. Using the proposed device, we also presented a biofeedback interactive VR system.","2019","2025-11-07 06:52:40","2025-11-07 06:52:40","","5–6","","","","","","","SA '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Brisbane, QLD, Australia","","","","virtual reality; biofeedback; biological information measurement; head mounted display","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is, however, little evidence that these soundscapes have the effects that they claim to have. Previous research exploring the effect of listening to background music during tasks has shown that while such music may have a positive effect on emotional state, it can disrupt reading and memory-based tasks. This paper explores the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. A diary study of the use of soundscapes whilst studying suggests that students view such soundscapes as: aiding focus whilst studying; creating feelings of calm and peace; helping to manage stress and anxiety; and hiding distracting sounds. A second study – an experiment – investigated the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. Whilst we found no effect of soundscapes on mood and arousal during the task, our results demonstrate that high acoustic variation in a soundscape may cause a disruption to serial recall tasks. The implications of our findings suggest that nature soundscapes with high acoustic variation may be detrimental to task performance compared to working in silence for serial based thinking tasks.","2017","2025-11-07 06:53:00","2025-11-07 06:53:00","","2802–2809","","","","","","","CHI EA '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Denver, Colorado, USA","","","","nature; mood; soundscapes; task performance; workplace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-visual content production and research for visually impaired users are underrepresented. Similarly, in the field of music, visual interfaces dominate discussions on gesture-based sound synthesis, leaving intuitive, audience-driven experiences unexplored. Historically, studies in architecture and music focused on spatial and musical sequences, but they largely remained confined to print media representations. In this project, inspired by the progressive structure of electronic music, we introduce a spatialized sound synthesis method based on distance-related audio effect modulation combined with binaural spatialization. This approach is intended to navigate users through space without depending on visual indicators, utilizing auditory cues from a multitude of virtual audio objects instead. These objects are responsive to user movements, providing dynamic and immersive musical experiences on a walking scale. Interaction with specific audio objects enables users to dictate different musical progressions, which follows a self-similar spatial structure. Unlike traditional sonification methods that translate data into plain audio, our approach emphasizes the emotional impact of auditory messages. It unveils the potential for audience-involved, spatially-driven musical narratives. Testing across various platforms, we faced challenges in sound design, hardware limitations, and cognitive processing.","2024","2025-11-07 06:53:00","2025-11-07 06:53:00","","","","","","","","","SIGGRAPH '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Denver, CO, USA","","","","Accessibility; Augmented Reality; Interactive Music; Mixed Reality; Sonification; Spatial Audio; Spatial Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wilson to describe what he believes is humanity's innate affinity for the natural world. In his landmark book Biophilia, he examined how our tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes might be a biologically based need, integral to our development as individuals and as a species. That idea has caught the imagination of diverse thinkers.The Biophilia Hypothesis brings together the views of some of the most creative scientists of our time, each attempting to amplify and refine the concept of biophilia. The variety of perspectives -- psychological, biological, cultural, symbolic, and aesthetic -- frame the theoretical issues by presenting empirical evidence that supports or refutes the hypothesis. Numerous examples illustrate the idea that biophilia and its converse, biophobia, have a genetic component: fear, and even full-blown phobias of snakes and spiders are quick to develop with very little negative reinforcement, while more threatening modern artifacts -- knives, guns, automobiles -- rarely elicit such a response people find trees that are climbable and have a broad, umbrella-like canopy more attractive than trees without these characteristics people would rather look at water, green vegetation, or flowers than built structures of glass and concrete The biophilia hypothesis, if substantiated, provides a powerful argument for the conservation of biological diversity. More important, it implies serious consequences for our well-being as society becomes further estranged from the natural world. Relentless environmental destruction could have a significant impact on our quality of life, not just materially but psychologically and even spiritually","1993","2025-11-17 20:45:54","2025-11-17 20:45:54","","","484","","","","","","A Shearwater book","","","","Island Press/Shearwater Books","Washington, D.C Covelo California","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","","","Kellert, Stephen R.; Wilson, Edward O.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
